# Documentation for creators and maintainers of OSCAL tools and content

Summarize audiences from the "OSCAL users" section of OSCAL-Overview.md. 

Information to present to implementers includes:
* The high-level OSCAL model (how OSCAL is organized, what the function of each component is, how the components are related). "OSCAL components and high-level architecture" section of OSCAL-Overview.md shows the high-level architecture and defines each component. "Terminology" section of OSCAL-Overview.md defines "control", "catalog" and "profile". Profile-Catalog-Relationship.md explains the relationship between profiles and catalogs.
* The OSCAL document model and tagging specification (docs/schema/oscal-tag-library.md)
* OSCAL examples. Slides 14 through 18 in the OSCAL Overview presentation illustrate how prose becomes OSCAL.
* Pointers to schemas and Schematron files

Are there multiple audiences within implementers that will want distinct subsets of information? Or will different people need different combinations of information?

A good example of how to engage people is at https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/. It briefly explains what is available, why it would be beneficial, and what to do next (with links to other docs for installing and setting up a local copy, etc.)
