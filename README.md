# Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) 

Give a brief summary of OSCAL. (NIST is developing OSCAL, a hierarchical, formatted, XML-based (and JSON translation) schema that provides a standard for representing different categories of information pertaining to the publication, implementation, and assessment of security controls.)

Talk about the basic motivations and principles for OSCAL?

Define the primary audiences and give each pointers to the main documentation page with more info for them.
