# Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) 

Give a brief summary of OSCAL. (NIST is developing OSCAL, a hierarchical, formatted, XML-based (and JSON translation) schema that provides a standard for representing different categories of information pertaining to the publication, implementation, and assessment of security controls.)

Talk about the basic motivations and principles for OSCAL?

Define the primary audiences and give each pointers to the main documentation page with more info for them. 
* Producers: catalog and profile maintainers, tool vendors. 
* Consumers: operations personnel, security & privacy personnel, auditors/assessors, policy personnel. At this time, do we have any content for consumers other than general OSCAL overview info? When will there be OSCAL tools and content for consumers? 
* Contributors (to the OSCAL project itself). Point them to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

Have pointer to the OSCAL overview [docs/prose/OSCAL-Overview.md](docs/prose/OSCAL-Overview.md) for people who are interested in learning more about OSCAL in general.
