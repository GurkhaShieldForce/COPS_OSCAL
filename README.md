# Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) 

NIST is developing OSCAL, a hierarchical, formatted, XML-based (and JSON translation) schema that provides a standard for representing different categories of information pertaining to the publication, implementation, and assessment of security controls. 

Talk about the basic motivations and principles for OSCAL?

Define the primary audiences (producers, consumers, and contributors), and give each pointers to the main documentation page with more info for them.

Could also have pointer here to the OSCAL overview [docs/prose/OSCAL-Overview.md](docs/prose/OSCAL-Overview.md) for people who are interested in learning more about OSCAL in general.
