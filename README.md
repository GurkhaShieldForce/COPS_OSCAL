# Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) 

> Current work is happening in the [master](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/) branch.

NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL), a set of hierarchical, formatted, XML- and JSON-based formats that provide a standardized representation for different categories of information pertaining to the publication, implementation, and assessment of security controls. OSCAL is being developed through a [collaborative approach](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with the public. Public contributions to this project are welcome.

The [OSCAL website](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) provides an overview of the OSCAL project, including an XML and JSON [schema reference](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/schema/), [examples](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/examples/), and other resources.

This repository consists of the following directories pertaining to the OSCAL project:

  * [docs](docs): Documentation graphics, prose, progress updates, and presentation slides
  * [examples](examples): OSCAL examples, including both demo (unit test) and "real world" examples
  * [schema](schema): OSCAL schemas and validation tools
  * [sources](sources): Resources used to produce OSCAL artifacts that are not maintained by the OSCAL project (e.g., a copy of the NIST SP 800-53 control data feed schema)
  * [working](working): Development artifacts (e.g., XML, XSLT, CSS, script, Markdown, and sample files, plus supporting files); additional documentation is posted under [working/doc](working/doc):
