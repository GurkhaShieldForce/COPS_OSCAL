# Documentation for users of OSCAL tools and content

Summarize audiences from "OSCAL users" section of OSCAL-Overview.md and explain the benefits OSCAL can provide (from the same place). 

At this time, do we have any content for users other than general OSCAL overview info? When will there be OSCAL tools and content ready for use? We may just want to make this a placeholder, informing people that OSCAL tools and content are not yet available for operational use. We could point them to OSCAL examples so they can get an idea for what OSCAL content may look like.
