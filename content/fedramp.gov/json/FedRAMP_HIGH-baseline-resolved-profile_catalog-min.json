guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and\n               service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented\n               by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the\n               information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the\n               requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring\n               administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny\n               by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner,\n               or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and\n               privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other\n               attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes\n               required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day,\n               day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations\n               consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades)\n               and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer\n               requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider\n               these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency\n               accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary\n               accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for\n               short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.\n               Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with\n               the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may\n               bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are\n               not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used\n               for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are\n               unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic\n               disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts\n               include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no\n               longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types\n               of information system accounts may require specialized training.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related","text":"AC-5"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-10","rel":"related","text":"AC-10"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related","text":"AC-20"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related","text":"IA-2"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related","text":"IA-4"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related","text":"IA-5"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related","text":"IA-8"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related","text":"CM-11"},{"href":"#ma-3","rel":"related","text":"MA-3"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related","text":"MA-5"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","text":"SC-13"}]},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping\n               export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet,\n               blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting\n               web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and\n               limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and\n               content. Transferring information between information systems representing different\n               security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers\n               violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information\n               owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between\n               interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural\n               solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes,\n               for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems\n               (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way\n               information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to\n               reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ\n               information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of\n               information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals,\n               and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow\n               control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information\n               path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g.,\n               gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or\n               establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a\n               packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering\n               capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\n               document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of\n               filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)\n               that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22\n               primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering\n               techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented\n               in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are\n               generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology\n               products.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-21","rel":"related","text":"AC-21"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-7","rel":"related","text":"CM-7"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sc-2","rel":"related","text":"SC-2"},{"href":"#sc-5","rel":"related","text":"SC-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-18","rel":"related","text":"SC-18"}]},{"id":"ac-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-4_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines information flow control policies to control the flow of\n                  information within the system and between interconnected systems; and"},{"id":"ac-4_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[2]"}],"prose":"the information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow\n                  of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on\n                  organization-defined information flow control policies."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\ninformation flow control policies\\n\\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\ninformation system baseline configuration\\n\\nlist of information flow authorizations\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developers"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-4.8","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Security Policy Filters","parameters":[{"id":"ac-4.8_prm_1","label":"organization-defined security policy filters"},{"id":"ac-4.8_prm_2","label":"organization-defined information flows"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(8)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-04.08"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.8_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system enforces information flow control using {{ ac-4.8_prm_1 }} as a basis for flow control decisions for {{ ac-4.8_prm_2 }}."},{"id":"ac-4.8_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Organization-defined security policy filters can address data structures and\n                  content.

Organizations can implement more\n                  than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g.,\n                  employing clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce\n                  false positives)."},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(8)[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines security policy filters to be used as a basis for\n                     enforcing flow control decisions;"},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(8)[2]"}],"prose":"the organization defines information flows for which flow control decisions are\n                     to be applied and enforced; and"},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(8)[3]"}],"prose":"the information system enforces information flow control using\n                     organization-defined security policy filters as a basis for flow control\n                     decisions for organization-defined information flows."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\ninformation flow control policies\\n\\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nlist of security policy filters regulating flow control decisions\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developers"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}]}]},{"id":"ac-4.21","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Physical / Logical Separation of Information Flows","parameters":[{"id":"ac-4.21_prm_1","label":"organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques"},{"id":"ac-4.21_prm_2","label":"organization-defined required separations by types of information"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(21)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-04.21"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.21_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system separates information flows logically or physically using\n                     {{ ac-4.21_prm_1 }} to accomplish {{ ac-4.21_prm_2 }}."},{"id":"ac-4.21_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance protection by\n                  ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling flow\n                  control by transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable.

These situations occur when, for example, there are\n               pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established\n               between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such\n               trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or\n               policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel,\n               contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational\n               information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules\n               of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on\n               authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending\n               upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may\n               choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local,\n               or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of external information\n               systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g.,\n               individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations\n               establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in\n               accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions\n               address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational\n               information systems from external information systems; and the highest security\n               category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external\n               information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information\n               systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on\n               organizational personnel using those external systems.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ca-3","rel":"related","text":"CA-3"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sa-9","rel":"related","text":"SA-9"}]},{"id":"ac-20_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any\n               trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or\n               maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to: ","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(a)"}],"prose":"access the information system from the external information systems; and"},{"id":"ac-20.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(b)"}],"prose":"process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external\n                  information systems."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing the use of external information systems\\n\\nexternal information systems terms and conditions\\n\\nlist of types of applications accessible from external information systems\\n\\nmaximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or transmitted\n                  on external information systems\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining terms and conditions\n                  for use of external information systems to access organizational systems\\n\\nsystem/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on use of external\n                  information systems"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-20.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Limits On Authorized Use","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-20.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information\n                  system to access the information system or to process, store, or transmit\n                  organization-controlled information only when the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external\n                     system as specified in the organization’s information security policy and\n                     security plan; or"},{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with\n                     the organizational entity hosting the external information system."}]},{"id":"ac-20.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals\n                  using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to\n                  access organizational information systems.

Audit events can\n               include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to\n               information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or\n               third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events,\n               organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to\n               be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs,\n               this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are\n               audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that\n               information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful\n               and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances\n               due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including\n               the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and\n               control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required\n               by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and\n               standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including\n               at the packet level as information traverses the network.

FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring;\n               and (iv) system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure\n               that information security is built into organizational information systems; (ii)\n               identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide\n               essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security\n               authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation\n               procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from\n               Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented\n               in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can\n               use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system\n               monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire\n               life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient\n               detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and\n               completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented\n               correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to\n               meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls\n               at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those\n               activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes.\n               Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for\n               the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in\n               support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or\n               authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment\n               requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources:\n               (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring;\n               or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security\n               assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control\n               effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence.\n               Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the\n               results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as\n               needed.

Impartiality implies\n                  that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with\n                  regard to the development, operation, or management of the organizational\n                  information systems under assessment or to the determination of security control\n                  effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual\n                  or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being\n                  conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the\n                  organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy\n                  for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be\n                  obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or\n                  private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine\n                  the required level of independence based on the security categories of information\n                  systems and/or the ultimate risk to organizational operations, organizational\n                  assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of\n                  assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and\n                  can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining\n                  whether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for\n                  example, when information system owners are not directly involved in contracting\n                  processes or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting\n                  assessments. In special situations, for example, when organizations that own the\n                  information systems are small or organizational structures require that\n                  assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,\n                  operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment\n                  processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully\n                  reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the\n                  completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.

Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for\n               organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business\n               operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an\n               inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be\n               federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials\n               assume responsibility and are accountable for security risks associated with the\n               operation and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly, authorizing\n               officials are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding\n               and accepting such information security-related risks.

Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities\n               or determine the degree of resistance organizational information systems have to\n               adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or\n               skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in\n               carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth\n               analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the\n               results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities.\n               Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware\n               components of an information system and can exercise both physical and technical\n               security controls.

Security impact analyses may also include\n               assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine\n               if additional security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in\n               accordance with the security categories of the information systems.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related","text":"CA-2"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related","text":"CM-3"},{"href":"#cm-9","rel":"related","text":"CM-9"},{"href":"#sa-4","rel":"related","text":"SA-4"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sa-10","rel":"related","text":"SA-10"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related","text":"SI-2"}]},{"id":"cm-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine\n               potential security impacts prior to change implementation."},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Configuration management policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing security impact analysis for changes to the information\n                  system\\n\\nconfiguration management plan\\n\\nsecurity impact analysis documentation\\n\\nanalysis tools and associated outputs\\n\\nchange control records\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibility for conducting security impact\n                  analysis\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem/network administrators"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational processes for security impact analysis"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"cm-4.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Separate Test Environments","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-4(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"cm-04.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-4.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test\n                  environment before implementation in an operational environment, looking for\n                  security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional\n                  malice."},{"id":"cm-4.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is physically\n                  or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment.

Information technology products for which\n               security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example,\n               mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web,\n               proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners,\n               copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice\n               and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating\n               systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those\n               parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the\n               parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related\n               parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory\n               permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services,\n               and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration\n               settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The\n               established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure\n               configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and\n               hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation\n               guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate\n               secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products\n               and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet\n               operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety\n               of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers,\n               manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other\n               organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include\n               the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the\n               implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security\n               Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol\n               (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely\n               identify, track, and control configuration settings.

Some of the\n               functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support\n               essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it\n               is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system\n               components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any\n               one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a\n               single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both).\n               Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or\n               individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and\n               services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant\n               Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused\n               or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File\n               Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to\n               prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or\n               unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion\n               detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and\n               host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited\n               functions, ports, protocols, and services.","links":[{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"}]},{"id":"cm-7_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(a)"}],"prose":"configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines prohibited or restricted:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][a]"}],"prose":"functions;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][b]"}],"prose":"ports;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][c]"}],"prose":"protocols;

Configuration items are the information\n               system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be\n               configuration-managed. As information systems continue through the system development\n               life cycle, new configuration items may be identified and some existing configuration\n               items may no longer need to be under configuration control.","links":[{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related","text":"CM-3"},{"href":"#cm-4","rel":"related","text":"CM-4"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-8","rel":"related","text":"CM-8"},{"href":"#sa-10","rel":"related","text":"SA-10"}]},{"id":"cm-9_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization develops, documents, and implements a configuration\n               management plan for the information system that:","parts":[{"id":"cm-9.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-9.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(a)[1]"}],"prose":"addresses roles;"},{"id":"cm-9.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(a)[2]"}],"prose":"addresses responsibilities;"},{"id":"cm-9.a_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(a)[3]"}],"prose":"addresses configuration management processes and procedures;"}]},{"id":"cm-9.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(b)"}],"prose":"establishes a process for:","parts":[{"id":"cm-9.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(b)[1]"}],"prose":"identifying configuration items throughout the SDLC;"},{"id":"cm-9.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(b)[2]"}],"prose":"managing the configuration of the configuration items;"}]},{"id":"cm-9.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-9.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the configuration items for the information system;"},{"id":"cm-9.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(c)[2]"}],"prose":"places the configuration items under configuration management;"}]},{"id":"cm-9.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(d)"}],"prose":"protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized:","parts":[{"id":"cm-9.d_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-9(d)[1]"}],"prose":"disclosure;

systems is part of an overall organizational\n               program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.\n               Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation\n               of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. The\n               effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning\n               throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing contingency\n               planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of\n               achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of\n               restoration required for organizational information systems since not all systems may\n               need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired.\n               Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders,\n               directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to\n               information system availability, contingency plans also address other\n               security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission and/or business\n               effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or\n               integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for\n               example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a\n               manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when\n               systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident\n               handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning\n               activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident.","links":[{"href":"#ac-14","rel":"related","text":"AC-14"},{"href":"#cp-6","rel":"related","text":"CP-6"},{"href":"#cp-7","rel":"related","text":"CP-7"},{"href":"#cp-8","rel":"related","text":"CP-8"},{"href":"#cp-9","rel":"related","text":"CP-9"},{"href":"#cp-10","rel":"related","text":"CP-10"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#ir-8","rel":"related","text":"IR-8"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related","text":"MP-2"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related","text":"MP-4"},{"href":"#mp-5","rel":"related","text":"MP-5"},{"href":"#pm-8","rel":"related","text":"PM-8"},{"href":"#pm-11","rel":"related","text":"PM-11"}]},{"id":"cp-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Organizations may require unique\n               identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or\n               for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords,\n               tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor\n               authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information\n               systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\n               access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf\n               of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of\n               networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or\n               processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network\n               connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that\n               involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal\n               networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of\n               encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between\n               organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be\n               treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality\n               and integrity of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the\n               identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the\n               requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the\n               specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the\n               use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are\n               defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number\n               [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token);\n               or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require\n               devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,\n               hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart\n               cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD\n               common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the\n               information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification\n               and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide\n               increased information security. Identification and authentication requirements for\n               other than organizational users are described in

Security plans contain sufficient information (including\n               the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either\n               explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is\n               unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of\n               risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and\n               the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply\n               tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS\n               Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized\n               requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g.,\n               DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and\n               Access Management, space operations).

The information security architecture at the individual\n               information system level is consistent with and complements the more global,\n               organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is\n               integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information\n               security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation\n               of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information\n               for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the\n               protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security\n               architecture can include other important security-related information, for example,\n               user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements,\n               the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information\n               system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and\n               any other specific protection needs. In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming\n               less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going\n               to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers.\n               Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to\n               developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,\n               developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline\n               configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and\n               maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the\n               information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for\n               Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to\n               support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is\n               primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that\n               organizations develop an information security architecture for the information\n               system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to\n               the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security\n               architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information\n               technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used\n               internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is\n               complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of\n               information systems or information system components to external entities, and there\n               is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise\n               architecture and information security architecture.","links":[{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#pm-7","rel":"related","text":"PM-7"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"related","text":"SA-17"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4","rel":"related","text":"Appendix J"}]},{"id":"pl-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization: ","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)"}],"prose":"develops an information security architecture for the information system that\n                  describes:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a.1_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(1)"}],"prose":"the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to\n                     protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational\n                     information;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.2_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(2)"}],"prose":"how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the\n                     enterprise architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.3_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(3)"}],"prose":"any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external\n                     services;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to review and update the information security\n                     architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[2]"}],"prose":"reviews and updates the information security architecture with the\n                     organization-defined frequency to reflect updates in the enterprise\n                     architecture;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"conformity","ns":"https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal","value":"assessment-objective"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"method","class":"fedramp","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)"}],"prose":"ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected\n                  in:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[1]"}],"prose":"the security plan;"},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[2]"}],"prose":"the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS);

To apply the required security controls within the system development life\n               cycle requires a basic understanding of information security, threats,\n               vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business functions.\n               The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals\n               that design, code, and test information systems and system components (including\n               information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations\n               include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers,\n               security architects, security engineers, and information system security officers in\n               system development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are\n               incorporated into organizational information systems.

The effective integration of\n               security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that\n               important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life\n               cycle and that those considerations are directly related to the organizational\n               mission/business processes.

Information system components include commercial information\n               technology products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities,\n               security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength requirements\n               associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of\n               correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering\n               or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development processes,\n               procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and\n               assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security\n               functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been\n               achieved. Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system\n               development life cycle. Security functionality, assurance, and documentation\n               requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements\n               that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring\n               process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use\n               of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies\n               and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and\n               administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security\n               controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the\n               security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to\n               which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or\n               mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the\n               organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include\n               organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports,\n               protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information\n               system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as\n               such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.

Configuration items that are placed under configuration\n               management (if existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the\n               formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other\n               design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the\n               running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of\n               security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with\n               previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the\n               mission/business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual\n               relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support\n               during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.","links":[{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related","text":"CM-3"},{"href":"#cm-4","rel":"related","text":"CM-4"},{"href":"#cm-9","rel":"related","text":"CM-9"},{"href":"#sa-12","rel":"related","text":"SA-12"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related","text":"SI-2"}]},{"id":"sa-10_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Security\n               properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection of system\n               components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes (e.g.,\n               upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect\n               previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of\n               security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate\n               potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as\n               static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three\n               approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools\n               (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and\n               in source code reviews.

The\n               coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type)\n               of the artifacts included in the assessment process.

Malicious code includes, for example,\n               viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in\n               various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden\n               files, or hidden in files using steganography.

External\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system\n               boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information\n               system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing\n               audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access\n               patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may\n               guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is\n               achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection\n               systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning\n               tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic\n               locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations\n               and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically\n               being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17.\n               Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can also\n               be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information\n               collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of\n               information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of\n               interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that\n               bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of\n               organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from\n               system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response\n               programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates\n               through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any\n               connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the\n               Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or\n               wireless.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-8","rel":"related","text":"AC-8"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-2","rel":"related","text":"AU-2"},{"href":"#au-6","rel":"related","text":"AU-6"},{"href":"#au-7","rel":"related","text":"AU-7"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related","text":"PE-3"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-26","rel":"related","text":"SC-26"},{"href":"#sc-35","rel":"related","text":"SC-35"},{"href":"#si-3","rel":"related","text":"SI-3"},{"href":"#si-7","rel":"related","text":"SI-7"}]},{"id":"si-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine
