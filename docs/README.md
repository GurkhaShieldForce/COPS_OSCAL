# Thoughts on OSCAL /docs Directory

The existing /docs directory in the sprint-6 branch has the following content:

* README.md, which contains a one-sentence description of what the directory contains and links to its top-level subdirectories
* graphics, which contains graphics source files
* presentations, which contains presentation source files in Powerpoint and PDF formats
* prose, which contains Markdown files with an OSCAL overview and detailed information on profiles and catalogs
* schema, which contains documentation in OSCAL XML format of schema and Schematrons, and points to the tag library, OSCAL examples, and schemas
