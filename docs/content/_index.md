    NIST, in collaboration with industry, is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). OSCAL is a set of formats expressed in XML, JSON, and YAML. These formats provide machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results.

# Use Information in OSCAL Formats

Control-based information expressed using OSCAL formats allows you to:

- Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs
- Establish and share machine-readable control baselines
- Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in your systems
- Automate the monitoring and assessment of your system control implementation effectiveness

If you are new to the OSCAL project, we provide [learning material](learnmore/) on the project.
