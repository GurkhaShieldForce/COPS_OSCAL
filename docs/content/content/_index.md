[OSCAL stakeholders](/about/stakeholders/) use OSCAL's standardized XML, JSON, and YAML data formats to share information between different parties as their use cases require.

Publishing content in OSCAL data formats allows practitioners to exchange security data with increased efficiency, reliability, and consistency. Categories for such content are listed below.

- [Catalogs](../concepts/layer/control/catalog/) of controls from security and privacy frameworks
- [Profiles](../concepts/layer/control/profile/) to scope and tailor control catalogs from security and privacy frameworks 
- [Component definitions](../concepts/layer/implementation/component-definition/) with reusable descriptions of controls supported in a given implementation of a hardware, software, service, policy, process, or procedure
- Templates to help with the creation of [system security plans](../concepts/layer/implementation/ssp/), [assessments plans](../concepts/layer/assessment/assessment-plan/), [assessment results](../concepts/layer/assessment/assessment-results/), and [POA&amp;Ms](../concepts/layer/assessment/poam/) for varying use cases

## Submission Guidelines
