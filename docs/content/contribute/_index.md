We are excited that you want to learn more about the OSCAL project. The OSCAL community is a collaborative environment of professionals contributing to the project's goals and objectives. The focus is to improve security assessment efficiency, accuracy, and consistency on the basis of real-world experience with the technology. The language we develop must be well-defined and easy to use for both human and machine-readable formats, improving both the User Experience (UX) and the Machine Experience (MX).

Our stakeholders are segmented, as is our industry, into constituencies with various needs. Please decide which category or categories you fit into, then go from there.

- [Security Professionals](/learnmore/stakeholders/securitypros/) -- You are responsible for documenting security controls and how they are applied within a system.
- [Assessors](/learnmore/stakeholders/assessors/) -- You are responsible for assessing security-related information produced by others.
- [Tool Developers](/learnmore/stakeholders/tooldevelopers/) -- You build tools and utilities to help other players, enabling them to do more work more consistently, thoroughly, accurately and easily.
- [Policy Authors](/learnmore/stakeholders/contentcreators/) -- You write policy documents (catalogs or profiles/baselines/overlays) defining, characterizing and customizing security controls for others to use.

## Tools

All users but especially tool developers should consider reaching out and connecting with others using your technology stack or platform. See our [Resources page](/downloads/other-resources/) for more.
