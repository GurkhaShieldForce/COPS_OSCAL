Note: (12/19/2019) We have had a change in the teleconferencing solution we are using for this meeting. We are switching from WebEx to Bluejeans. As a result, we have setup a single meeting for the Thursday, December 5th 2019 teleconference. Meeting info for the next teleconference on Thursday, December 19th, 2019 will be posted here in before that meeting. Please check back for updated details.

Each teleconference will cover the following:

- The OSCAL team will provide a *short summary* of **what we are currently working on**. (5 to 10 minutes)
- The OSCAL team will **discuss issues** that we need **community feedback** on or **help with**, if we have any for that week. (0 to 10 minutes)
- The remainder of the call will be **available to answer questions on OSCAL**. This is an opportunity **ask clarifying questions**, to **discuss features** you would like to see in OSCAL, and to **report potential defects** you have found. We specifically want to hear from community members that are authoring OSCAL content and creating OSCAL tools. ***Your [feedback](/contribute/contact/) is important to us***, which is the primary reason we are hosting these teleconferences.

We look forward to talking with you about OSCAL.
