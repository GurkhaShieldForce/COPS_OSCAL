The OSCAL assessment layer provides the OSCAL [assessment plan model](assessment-plan/), which defines structured, machine-readable XML, JSON, and YAML representations of the information contained within an assessment plan. An assessment plan describes how and when a system assessment is intended to be performed, the scope of the assessment, and what assessment activities should be conducted. The OSCAL assessment plan model is the sole model in the OSCAL assessment layer of the OSCAL [architecture](/learnmore/architecture/).
