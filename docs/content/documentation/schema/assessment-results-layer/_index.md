The OSCAL assessment layer provides the OSCAL [assessment results](assessment-results/) and the [plan of action and milestones](assessment-results/) models, which define structured, machine-readable XML, JSON, and YAML representations of the information generated by an assessment.

The OSCAL assessment results layer is part of the OSCAL [architecture](/learnmore/architecture/).
