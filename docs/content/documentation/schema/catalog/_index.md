The OSCAL Catalog model represents the information contained within a [control catalog](/learnmore/architecture/catalog/). The Catalog model is the sole model in the OSCAL [Catalog](/learnmore/architecture/) layer.

The NIST SP 800-53 rev 4 control catalog is provided as an example in the OSCAL GitHub repository in [XML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/xml/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_catalog.xml), [JSON](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/json/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_catalog.json), and [YAML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/yaml/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_catalog.yaml) formats.
