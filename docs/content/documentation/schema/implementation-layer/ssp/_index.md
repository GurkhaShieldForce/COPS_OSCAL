The OSCAL system security plan (SSP) model represents a description of the control implementation of an information system. The SSP model is part of the OSCAL [implementation](../) layer.

The OSCAL SSP model enables full modeling of highly granular SSP content, including points of contact, system characteristics, and control satisfaction descriptions. At a more detailed level, this includes the system's authorization boundary, information types and categorization, inventory, and attachments. In terms of control satisfaction, it models control parameter values, responsible roles, implementation status, control origination, and a description of control satisfaction at a level of granularity down to a specific control statement. Control satisfaction can be defined for the system as a whole or for individual implemented components.
