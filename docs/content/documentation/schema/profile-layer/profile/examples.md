The following OSCAL Profile model examples are provided.

## NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Baselines

The NIST HIGH, MODERATE and LOW baselines for the SP800-53 rev4 catalog are available [in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4):

* [HIGH](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/xml/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_HIGH-baseline_profile.xml)
* [MODERATE](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/xml/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_MODERATE-baseline_profile.xml)
* [LOW](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/xml/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_LOW-baseline_profile.xml)

There are also [JSON](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/json) and [YAML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/yaml) versions of the NIST SP 800-53 rev4 profiles.

## FedRAMP Baselines

Also find examples representing the FedRAMP baselines (again for the HIGH, MODERATE and LOW impact levels) on [our web site](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/master/content/fedramp.gov).

* [HIGH](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/fedramp.gov/xml/FedRAMP_HIGH-baseline_profile.xml)
* [MODERATE](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/fedramp.gov/xml/FedRAMP_MODERATE-baseline_profile.xml)
* [LOW](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/fedramp.gov/xml/FedRAMP_LOW-baseline_profile.xml)

There are also [JSON](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/fedramp.gov/json) and [YAML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/fedramp.gov/yaml) versions of the FedRAMP profiles.
