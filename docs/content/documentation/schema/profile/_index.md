The OSCAL Profile model represents a baseline of selected controls from one or more control catalogs, which is referred to as a "[profile](/learnmore/architecture/profile/)" in OSCAL. The Profile model is the sole model in the OSCAL [Profile](/learnmore/architecture/) layer.

Multiple examples of baselines expressed using the OSCAL profile model can be found in the OSCAL GitHub repository in multiple formats:
