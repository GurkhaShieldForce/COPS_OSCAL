## Models

The models are documented in the OSCAL [Layers and Models Reference](/documentation/schema/).

## Processing

Some processing rules are defined for OSCAL content.

### Profile Resolution

The processing rules for **profile resolution** are provided in the [profile resolution specification](/documentation/specification/processing/profile-resolution/).
