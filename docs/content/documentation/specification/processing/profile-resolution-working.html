    <!--description: A profile implicitly defines a control set; profile resolution makes this
      control set explicit and available for further processing.-->
    <p>A profile in OSCAL represents a selection and configuration of a set of controls. Ordinarily
      the set of controls available to a profile is provided by a catalog. For example, the three
      NIST SP 800-53 profiles representing the impact baselines HIGH, MODERATE and LOW: each of
      these calls on the full SP 800-53/53A catalog, and depends on a file or resource representing
      that catalog for its underlying information set.</p>
    <p>However, profiles may also select controls from profiles, implicitly selecting from
      underlying catalogs as modified. And they can select controls from more than one catalog or
      profile origin.</p>
    <p>In order to support these semantics, the results of resolving a single profile must be in the
      form of a single ('virtual' or implicit) catalog, as described below. Two different OSCAL
      processors that promise profile resolution, must deliver the same catalog with regard to its
      controls and the structure in which they are embedded (groups). This specification is designed
      to make this possible, by defining "the same" in this context.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Profile semantics</h2>
      <p>Considered as a "document" or integrated data set (object), a profile has three sections,
        each of which corresponds to a conceptual step in resolution. To resolve a catalog fully is
        to perform all these steps.</p>
      <p>While the steps are described in this specification as occurring in sequence, a profile
        processor is not obliged to perform them in the order described. Conformance to these
        specifications is determined by whether the results of processing (*resolution*) appear as
        described, not on whether the means to produce those results work in exactly the manner
        described here.</p>
      <p>The three steps are <em>import</em> (control selection); <em>merge</em>; and
          <em>modify</em>. In brief:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>import</strong> identifies one or more control sources (catalogs or profiles)
          and the controls within them to be included in this profile</li>
        <li><strong>merge</strong> produces the rules for how controls will be organized and merged
          (or not)</li>
        <li><strong>modify</strong> indicates how parameters in the underlying catalog may be
          modified or set, and how control contents may be amended or modified.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The selection stage is mandatory inasmuch as a profile that imports no controls is
        inoperative. Such a profile is not in error and it can be resolved, but it will contain no
        controls.</p>
      <p>The merge stage can be considered mandatory in that there are default rules for merging, to
        be followed when no merge behavior is given; thus "no merging" is permitted, and a profile
        with no merge semantics indicated is not in error.</p>
      <p>The modify stage is optional in that controls do not have to be modified and parameters do
        not have to be set; a profile is always free to represent these components as they are given
        in their catalogs. Leaving a parameter unset, or qualifying its setting (with additional
        information or constraints) without actually setting it, is also possible; like a catalog, a
        profile can represent a set of controls that is not fully defined, for purposes of use at
        another layer (profile or implementation) where such definition can be provided.</p>
      <p>When resolved, an OSCAL profile takes the form of an OSCAL catalog, whose organization and
        parts are described in the next section. The merge semantics described below will produce
        outputs conforming to this organization.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Import</h3>
        <p>An import must first indicate a resource from which a set of controls is to be imported.
          The resource can be either an OSCAL catalog or an OSCAL profile. A catalog provides
          controls in their native form. An imported profile is resolved on import, using the same
          rules for the resolution of the profile at the top level, so that it too appears as a
          catalog to the importing profile.</p>
        <p>No profile may import itself either directly or indirectly. An import directive that
          indicates either the profile itself, or a profile into which it is being (currently)
          imported, must be ignored. Optionally, a processor may issue a warning.</p>
        <p>In an import directive, the reference to the resource to be imported appears on an
            <code>href</code> flag. It takes either of two forms, external or internal:</p>
        <section>
          <h4>External</h4>
          <p>An external reference appears as an absolute or relative URL</p>
          <p>Indicating a file available via [prototol?]</p>
          <pre><code class="xml">&lt;import href="../../nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/xml/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_catalog.xml"&gt;
  &lt;include&gt;
	&lt;call control-id="ac-1"/&gt;
...
</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Internal</h4>
          <p>A catalog or profile to be imported can also be indicated using an internal link via a
            URI fragment identifier (starting with <code>#</code>). If an import href resolves to a
              <code>resource</code> elsewhere in the profile (typically in back matter), that
            resource can be retrieved to provide the source catalog.</p>
          <pre><code class="xml">&lt;import href="#nist-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;include&gt;
	&lt;call control-id="ac-1"/&gt;
  &lt;/include&gt;
&lt;/import&gt;

  ...
  
&lt;back-matter&gt;
  &lt;resource id="catalog"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;SP 800-53 catalog (OSCAL format) on Github&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;rlink href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4/xml/NIST_SP-800-53_rev4_catalog.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/back-matter&gt;
</code></pre>
          <p>An internal cross-reference from an import to a resource that does not reference a
            catalog or profile, or a cross-reference to something other than a resource, is
            inoperative. It may be signaled as an error [or warning] by a processor.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Circular imports</h4>
          <p>When a profile imports a profile, the subordinate profile is resolved into a catalog
            using the same rules. This presents a possibility of circular imports, when a profile is
            directed to import itself either directly or indirectly.</p>
          <p>A "circular import" is defined as a directive to import a resource, which has already
            been called higher in the import hierarchy. For example, if Profile A imports Profile B,
            and Profile B imports Profile A, the second import is circular. (An import at the top
            can only be circular if a profile tries to import itself.) If A imports B, B imports C
            and C imports A, C’s import is circular.</p>
          <p>Note that an import can only be circular within the context of processing a particular
            profile. In the last example, C’s import would not be circular if invoked in the context
            of resolving B by itself (without being imported by A), or of resolving some other
            profile that did not import A. (D importing B importing C importing A would not be a
            problem.)</p>
          <p>Circular imports are inoperative, and may be reported as an error [or warning].</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Multiple imports</h4>
          <p>Multiple imports of the same resource are not an error as long as no circular
            dependencies occur.</p>
          <p>However, multiple imports may result in invalid outputs. Typically this will be because
            a control has been selected twice, and no merge behavior (see below) has been given.</p>
          <p>Moreover, "sibling" imports While this condition must be reported, a processor is not
            obliged to stop, but may optionally resolve the resource in question by treating the two
            calls as a single call (unifying both <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code>
            statements in this case). This permits a downstream application to do something with the
            information. Even in this case a warning message must be indicated unless the processor
            is specifically set to a 'silent' mode.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Stability of documents returned by given URIs</h4>
          <p>The rules of XSLT <code>document()</code> apply to the traversal of any URI: that is,
            it is assumed that all calls to a given (resolved) URI reference, will return the same
            result.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Selecting controls</h4>
          <p>Imports can specify controls by inclusion and exclusion, either or both in
            combination.</p>
          <section>
            <h5>Inclusion</h5>
            <p>Using inclusion, all or some controls may be selected from a catalog.</p>
            <p>Select all controls from a catalog by using an "include all" rule:</p>
            <pre><code class="xml">&lt;include&gt;
  &lt;all/&gt;
&lt;/include&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>Alternatively, select individual controls or controls by groups using match patterns
              against their IDs.</p>
            <pre><code class="xml">&lt;include&gt;
  &lt;call control-id="ac-1"/&gt;
&lt;/include&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>All or some controls from a catalog are included in selection. (include/all)</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of selections, "calls" and "matches". (include/call |
              include/match)</p>
            <p>Calls and matches cannot be combined in a single include. To use both, use more than
              one include statement.</p>
            <p>A match is a selection of a control by matching its ID to the given match
              pattern.</p>
            <p>The match pattern is evaluated as a regular expression using XPath regular expression
              syntax. [XXXX]</p>
            <section>
              <h6>Including child controls</h6>
              <p>In OSCAL, controls may contain controls. For example, in SP 800-53 many controls
                are supplemented with control enhancements; in OSCAL these are represented as child
                controls within parent controls. So parent AC-2 has children AC-2(1) through AC-2(),
                for example.</p>
              <p>Child controls can be included by the same mechanism as controls, i.e. by means of
                an ID call. Alternatively a match can frequently be applied (at least given most ID
                assignment schemes) to match controls and child controls together.</p>
              <p>Additionally, a <code>with-child-controls</code> directive on a <code>call</code>
                or <code>match</code> can indicate that child controls (that is, direct children not
                all descendants) should be included with the applicable call(s) or match(es).</p>
              <p>XXX Furthermore, <code>all[@with-child-controls='no']</code> may select all
                controls <em>only at the top level</em> (i.e., directly inside <code>group</code>)
                from a catalog. XXXX</p>
            </section>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Exclusions</h5>
            <p>Exclusions work the same way as inclusions, except with the opposite effect - the
              indicated control(s) are dropped from the resource.</p>
            <p>Additionally, there is no such thing as exclude/all, which is invalid and should be
              considered inoperable.</p>
            <p>Any control that is both included and excluded, is excluded. This holds irrespective
              of the specifity of the selection for inclusion or exclusion. For example, if AC-1 is
              included by id 'ac-1' and excluded by matching 'ac*', it is excluded. Selection for
              exclusion prevails.</p>
          </section>
          <section><h5>Implicit "all"</h5><p>An empty import statement should be considered the same
              as an import with an "include/all". An empy import
            instruction</p><pre><code class="xml">&lt;import href="#nist-catalog"/&gt;
</code></pre>is
            functionally equivalent to
              this:<pre><code class="xml">&lt;import href="#nist-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;include&gt;
    &lt;all/&gt;
  &lt;/include&gt;
&lt;/import&gt;
</code></pre><p>The
              same thing occurs if an exclude instruction is given without an include
              instruction.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code class="xml">&lt;import href="#nist-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;exclude&gt;
    &lt;call control-id="ac-1"/&gt;
  &lt;/exclude&gt;
&lt;/import&gt;
</code></pre>is
            the same as
              this:<pre><code class="xml">&lt;import href="#nist-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;include&gt;
    &lt;all/&gt;

        <h3>Merge - defines rules on how to arrange / manage controls</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Colliding controls</h4>
          <p>"Colliding controls" (or "clashing") describes the condition that occurs when multiple
            invocations of controls with the same ID are given, and so a profile resolution will
            result in duplicative and/or contradictory information. Even given the rule against
            multiple imports of the same resource, it may frequently occur that in profiles under
            development, multiple copies – and with variations – of a given control may appear in a
            resolved profile. For example, if a profile tailors another profile which includes a
            control with amendments, and then (the top-level profile) includes the same control
            directly from its home catalog, a collision will occur between these two variants.</p>
          <p>Generally such a collision is readily detectable as long as IDs have not been modified;
            in other words, constraints over uniqueness (within document scope) of IDs will be
            violated in resolved instances where two (perhaps different) representations of the same
            control appear.</p>
          <section>
            <h5>merge combine[@method='keep']</h5>
            <p>This is also the default if not <code>merge/combine</code> directive is given. It
              indicates that colliding controls should simply be copied through, for handling
              downstream.</p>
            <p>While colliding controls will result in invalid documents under this setting, since
              care should be taken that controls do not collide in any case, this setting is useful
              in ensuring integrity.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>merge combine[@method='use-first']</h5>
            <p>The first reference to a given control prevails over later references. "First" is
              read in top-down, depth-first traversal of the tree. So if a profile is imported
              before a catalog, and the imported profile presents a representation of a control also
              given in the catalog import – the profile’s representation (perhaps modified) is
              taken.</p>
            <p>The same logic applies to parameter settings.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>merge combine[@method='merge']</h5>
            <p>The processor should merge all representations of a given control, into a single
              unified representation.</p>
            <p>The single unified representation is assembled by aggregating all the contents of all
              the (clashing) control instances and discarding duplicate branches.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="xml">&lt;control id="a1"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Control A1&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;prop name="label"&gt;A-1&lt;/prop&gt;

            <section>
              <h6>Implicit inclusions under "as is"</h6>
              <p>Under "as is", a resolved profile’s structure is expected to replicate the
                structure of source catalogs.</p>
              <p>This is achieved by propagating, with all controls that are included, all groups
                that they appear within, along with the groups’ IDs, titles and other contents.</p>
              <p>Groups that do not include controls that have been included (either directly or as
                descendants of contained groups, are not propagated to the result.</p>
              <p>In addition to groups, under 'as is' mergine, certain controls will be included
                implicitly. This happens when they have not been called, but they contain controls
                that have been called. Such controls are treated like groups included 'as is' – they
                must be propagated to retain the structure for descendant controls.</p>
              <p>Unlike groups, however, the title of such a control is given with the resolution,
                but no other contents are presented apart from (a) controls included explicitly or
                (b) child controls that must be included for the sake of their own (included) child
                (or descendant) controls.</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <pre><code class="xml">&lt;import href="#XYZ-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;include&gt;
    &lt;call control-id='xyz-1.1'/&gt;&lt;!-- bedtime routine control --&gt;
    &lt;call control-id='xyz-1.2.1'/&gt;&lt;!-- kitchen trashcan --&gt;
  &lt;/include&gt;
&lt;/import&gt;
</code></pre>
              <p>the result might be</p>
              <pre><code class="xml">&lt;control id="xyz-1"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Basic Hygiene&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;control id="xyz-1.1"&gt;&lt;!-- bedtime routine --&gt;...&lt;/control&gt;
  &lt;control id="xyz-1.2"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Kitchen cleanup&lt;/title&gt;

        <h3>Modify - controls are amended or modified</h3>
        <p>(Aka "patching") Explicit modification of control content</p>
        <p>There are two ways a control may need to be modified. Commonly, controls might be amended
          – new material might be added. (For example, P1-P3 in the SP800-53 LOW MODERATE and HIGH
          baselines.) Less commonly, materials might be removed or edited.</p>
        <p>OSCAL does not provide for "changing" a control, but editing can be achieved by removing
          contents and adding (edited) contents back. In other words, editing is considered to be
          the same kind of patching as removing combined with adding.</p>

          <p>Parameters are not always given within controls. A profile resolution result must
            include copies (with or without modifications or settings) of all parameters defined
            within the source catalog, which are referenced from 'insert' instructions anywhere
            inside included controls.</p>
          <p>A profile should not reproduce parameters from source catalogs, which are not
            referenced from 'insert' instructions.</p>
          <p>Setting of parameters occurs as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <code>set/title</code> replaces the <code>param/title</code> on the affected
              parameter</li>
            <li>A <code>set/label</code> replaces the <code>param/label</code> on the affected
              parameter</li>
            <li>A <code>set/value</code>
              <em>or</em> a <code>set/select</code> replaces <em>any</em>
              <code>param/value</code> or <code>param/select</code> on the affected parameter</li>
            <li>Other elements given in a parameter <code>set</code> are added to the affected
              parameter, after elements of the same name</li>
            <li>The prescribed order of all elements in the affected parameter is retained:
                <code>label</code>; <code>usage</code>; <code>constraint</code>;
                <code>guideline</code>; <code>value</code> or <code>select</code>; and
                <code>link</code>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>[example]</p>
          <pre><code class="xml">&lt;param id="p1"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Password length&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;10&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/param&gt;

...

&lt;set param-id="p1"&gt;
  &lt;select&gt;
    &lt;choice&gt;10&lt;/choice&gt;
    &lt;choice&gt;11&lt;/choice&gt;

      <h2>Profile resolution - conversion into a catalog</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Form and organization of resolution out</h3>
        <p>The output of a profile resolution should take the form of a catalog.</p>
        <p>(Validation against the catalog schema … recommended but not required?)</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>top-level @id</h3>
        <p>Because document IDs are sometimes used to distinguish data points in processing context,
          a resolved profile may not present the same ID as any of the catalogs it is importing, or
          the same ID as its source profile.</p>
        <p>It is permitted to produce the profile’s ID in resolution via a static mapping from the
          ID of the source. For example, the resolution of profile with ID 'profile-X' might have ID
          'profile-X-RESOLUTION'.</p>

        <h3>Profile back matter</h3>
        <p>Profiles may have back matter.</p>
        <p>Under the "no merge" rules, profile back matter is copied into the resulting catalog
          without modification, along with back matter filtered from imported catalogs and profiles
          (next section). This may result in invalid outputs when more than a single back-matter is
          given in the results.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Resource back matter</h3>
        <p>Back matter in OSCAL can contain either or both citations and resources.</p>
        <p>A citation is a reference to an out of line document, included for reference purposes.
          Controls may contain cross-references to these citations.</p>
        <p>A resource is like a citation, but is more tightly controlled with a more rigorous
          description. It is used to designate any materials that are either formally part of a
          document but not encoded with it (such as a file attachment in a foreign format), or
          materials with support for identification or authentication, such as by comparing
          cryptographic hashes.</p>
        <p>When a profile is resolved, only citations and resources that are actually referenced
          from contents in the catalog <em>as resolved</em>, should be included.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Result structure</h3>
        <p>The rest of the catalog is structured as follows:</p>
        <p>If no 'merge' was given, or if 'merge' is given without 'custom' or 'as-is', controls are
          flat.</p>
        <p>If merge/custom is used, see above.</p>
        <p>Special case rules for handling multiple imports - are controls grouped by their source
          catalogs (intermediate or ultimate) and should the import hierarchy be reflected?</p>
        <p>(Examples)</p>
