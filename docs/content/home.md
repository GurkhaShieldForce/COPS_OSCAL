tagline: Supporting<br/>Control-Based<br/>Risk Management<br/>with<br/>Standardized Formats

intro: |
  NIST, in collaboration with industry, is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). OSCAL is a set of formats expressed in XML, JSON, and YAML. These formats provide machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results.

  OSCAL allows organizations to:
  - Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs
  - Establish and share machine-readable control baselines
  - Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in their systems
  - Monitor and assess system control implementation effectiveness

  If you are new to the OSCAL project, we provide [learning material](learnmore/) on the project.
