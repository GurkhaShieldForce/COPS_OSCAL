The OSCAL project is working to address the following goals:

1. Drive a large decrease in the paperwork burden for both information security professionals and vendors.
    - Normalize the representation of security control catalogs, regulatory frameworks, and system information using precise, machine readable formats.
    - Allow the sharing of control implementation information across communities.
1. Improve the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of system security assessments.
    - Assess a system's compliance state against several sets of requirements simultaneously and ensure traceability between the requirements.
    - Enable assessments to be performed consistently, regardless of system type.
1. Allow a system's security state to be assessed more often, ideally continuously, driving continuous assurance.
    - Drive a large decrease in assessment-related labor, decreasing assessment and authorization time.
    - Support the evaluation of control implementation effectiveness based on data collected using a continuous monitoring capability.

## OSCAL Design Principles

To address these goals, the OSCAL project is guided by the following design principles:

- Produce a set of interoperable, extensible, machine-readable formats through a community-focused effort that supports a broad range of control-based risk management processes.
  - Provide XML-, JSON-, and YAML-based formats that allow for lossless translations between XML, JSON, and YAML representations.
  - Provide a common means to identify and version shared resources.
  - Standardize the expression of assessment artifacts, driving crowd-sourced development and improvement across profile and implementation layers.
- Align OSCAL models with current, practical information, and support advanced structures that provide for greater automation and verification.
  - Ensure security controls, implementation, and verification processes have full traceability and inherit at the baseline (software and service provider) and system interconnection levels.
  - Provides a path for early adoption and ongoing evolution around how OSCAL will be used.
