NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) as a standardized, data-centric framework that can be applied to an information system for documenting and assessing its security controls. Today, security controls and control baselines are represented in proprietary formats, requiring data conversion and manual effort to describe their implementation. An important goal of OSCAL is to move the security controls and control baselines from a text-based and manual approach (using word processors or spreadsheets) to a set of standardized and machine-readable formats. With systems security information represented in OSCAL, security professionals will be able to automate security assessment, auditing, and continuous monitoring processes.

## Why OSCAL?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD026 -->

There are a number of factors contributing to the challenges faced by information system security professionals today:

* multiple regulatory standards and frameworks (e.g., NIST [FISMA Implementation Project](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/federal-information-security-management-act-fisma-implementation-project), [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/), [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html), [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html)), which change over time;
* their overlapping scope and the requirement to manage them together; and
* the size, complexity and ongoing development of the systems being documented.

To provide assurance of a system's security posture, the implementation of security systems must be both correctly described, assessed and authorized against relevant security controls. Typically this process is resource-intensive, and often challenging within budget constraints given the complexity of the problem.

The standardized formats provided by the OSCAL project help to streamline and standardize the processes of documenting, implementing and assessing security controls. The automation enabled by the OSCAL formats will reduce complexity, decrease implementation costs, and enable the simultaneous, continuous assessment of a system's security against multiple sets of requirements. Additionally, paperwork will be significantly reduced.

## How OSCAL Supports Your Role?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD026 -->

Our stakeholders are segmented, as is our industry, into constituencies with various needs. Please decide which category or categories you fit into, then go from there.

* [Security Professionals]({{ site.baseurl }}/learnmore/securitypros/) -- You are responsible for documenting security controls and how they are applied within a system.
* [Assessors]({{ site.baseurl }}/learnmore/assessors/) -- You are responsible for assessing security-related information produced by others.
* [Tool Developers]({{ site.baseurl }}/learnmore/tooldevelopers/) -- You build tools and utilities to help other players, enabling them to do more work more consistently, thoroughly, accurately and easily.
* [Policy Authors]({{ site.baseurl }}/learnmore/contentcreators/) -- You write policy documents (catalogs or profiles/baselines/overlays) defining, characterizing and customizing security controls for others to use.
