# OSCAL Controls

In OSCAL, a control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security and/or privacy requirements. Although this is based on the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 definition of "control", its meaning has been broadened to encompass safeguards and countermeasures regardless of the level of detail used to define them and the types of information their definitions contain.

TBD: Show prose examples of an 800-53 control and a related control from another catalog. Illustrate the differences in the controls themselves and the terminology used for the parts of their definitions.
