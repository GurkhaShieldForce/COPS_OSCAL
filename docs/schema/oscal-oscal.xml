    <title>OSCAL namespace</title>
    <p>Conformant (valid) OSCAL documents will not contain elements not described in this document.
      While OSCAL may be mixed with other tag sets or extended, neither of these uses is described
      here: this document provides only basic information about the OSCAL <q>core</q>.</p>
    <p>The element population of an OSCAL document (set) may be determined by means of XPath
        <code>distinct-values(//*/node-name())</code>, or analogous query.</p>
    <p>For its XML names, OSCAL uses the namespace <a>http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0</a>.
      Commonly, this will be assigned to (unprefixed) names in an OSCAL document by default, and in
      this document, OSCAL elements (and attributes, presumed to be in no-namespace) are referenced
      without a prefix, <code>oscal:</code> or any other.</p>
    <p>By design, OSCAL looks a lot like HTML on the inside. Transformations to HTML, however, should
      always strip the OSCAL namespace to produce HTML in the appropriate namespace for the target
      application. (Or the target application could learn to consume OSCAL.) Only some parts of
      HTML, however, make their way into OSCAL, which is designed to address its own
      requirements.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>OSCAL organization</title>
    <p>OSCAL catalogs are built out of controls. By analogy, OSCAL <q>frameworks</q> and
        <q>worksheets</q> are constructed out of components, which may map to (correspond with)
      controls in a catalog.</p>
    <p>Both controls (in a catalog) and components (more generally) are like rows in a spreadsheet,
      with cells in the row designated for carrying labeled (and sometimes structured) information.
      To accommodate this, OSCAL is a lightweight and free-form <q>documentary</q> format, which
      includes semantic <q>islands</q> of structured information. These are semantic not only
      because they are addressable in principle, but more importantly because their organizations
      and values may be known before processing occurs, at least with respect to certain operations
      and relations, and even (at the most general level) before operations are designed and
      deployed. When encoded in OSCAL, control catalogs and the documents that make reference to
      them become <q>actionable</q> even at granular levels.</p>
    <p>At the broadest level, <q>control objects</q> in OSCAL include controls, subcontrols, parts
      of controls or subcontrols, and control groups. Each OSCAL application or application domain
      will determine for itself how these correspond to entities or <q>controls</q>, formal processes, procedures, and so forth, within that domain.</p>
    <p>This organization is governed by an XML schema, which enforces containment constraints among
      these elements. In particular, the OSCAL schema declares elements for <code>group</code>,
        <code>control</code>, <code>subcontrol</code>, <code>component</code>, and
      <code>part</code>. OSCAL can support organizations of information (in both catalogs and
      nominal <q>frameworks</q>) with arbitrary granularity, as any of these objects may be used
      consistently to carry regular sets of properties, with names and value spaces that may be
      known in advance or discovered dynamically.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Interoperability with other data formats</title>
    <p>OSCAL should map easily and straightforwardly to any generic XML or tag-based markup language
      including HTML, Markdown and its variants, NISO JATS, DITA, etc. Additionally, OSCAL
      documents may be taken as <q>warrants for inference</q> for serialization of linked data
      objects or other application binding formats including JSON.</p>
    <p>Because OSCAL is designed to carry richer and denser semantics than most markup languages, however, automated conversion into OSCAL from any of these formats (or at any rate, into a process-oriented and optimized OSCAL) is likely to require tuning or
      customization per instance - that is, each one will be a one-off conversion.</p>
  </section>
  <group>
    <title>Controls, components and their contents</title>
    <p>The foundations of OSCAL are in control objects, such as controls and subcontrols, and the
      structured information (loosely <q>objects</q>, represented as valid XML elements). These
      contents will include both structured contents (using element types as described here) and
      relatively uncontrolled or free-form contents (described elsewhere as <a
        href="oscal-oscal.xml#prose">prose</a>).</p>

          documented in control catalogs. This is a suitable element for representing, not a control
          catalog, but an overlay or customization that has its own organization, making
          many-to-many links across catalogs, their profiles, and other canonical reference
          documents. (A customization that does not reorganize, but only selects from and configures
          a control, can be a <code>profile</code>.)</p>
        <p>Despite their very different roles in the system (catalogs for canonical collections of
          controls, frameworks for most anything else), components inside frameworks and controls
          inside catalogs have the same kinds of content objects subject to similar kinds of
          restrictions. With respect to their internals, that is, they are closely aligned, which
          simplifies processing of information across the boundaries between them.</p>

          notation (not XML), as defined by and for an application.</p>
        <p>The lexical composition of properties may be constrained by declarations including
          matching to regular expressions or declaring known datatype notations (tbd).</p>
        <p>Because properties are often used as selectors or identifiers for OSCAL operations,
          their values can be expected frequently to be flattened (markup stripped) and normalized
          (e.g., with respect to whitespace) in use; however, this is application defined.</p>
        <p>For singletons (that is, the only element among siblings with its <code>@class</code>),
          properties are especially useful as proxies (unique identifiers) for their controls, such
          that controls may be returned one for one on queries for properties (name and value). The
          robustness of such queries can be ensured by appropriate property declarations (as
          singletons and as identifiers); cf <code>property</code> in the declarations model (which
          also supports other constraints over property values).</p>
        <p>Properties permit the deployment and management of arbitrary controlled values, with and
          among control objects (controls and parts and extensions), for any purpose useful to an
          application or implementation of those controls. Typically and routinely, properties will
          be used to sort, select, order, and arrange controls or relate them to one another or to
          class hierarchies, taxonomies, or external authorities.</p>

    <title>Declarations elements</title>
    <p>By declaring constraints on information associated with controls such as their properties
        (<code>prop</code>), parts (<code>part</code>) and links (<code>link</code>), applications
      and operators can validate the composition and consistency of available controls. Over and
      above the <q>core validation</q> of OSCAL element naming (which is enforced by direct
      application of an XML schema), such validation can help to guarantee processability and
      interchange of OSCAL data by verifying that not only tags, but also values given in the data,
      conform to expressed constraints, which can be made specific to a catalog or catalog type.</p>
    <p>In this way, the OSCAL declarations mechanism provides for a kind of <q>on the fly
        supertyping</q> of control objects, by restriction (constraint) of the core OSCAL language.
      The extent and degree to which declarations are used to impose order on controls is up to the
      application and its methods. By no means are declarations necessary; but they serve as an aid
      in modeling and in communicating expectations.</p>
    <p>OSCAL declarations are enforced by a Schematron; the core schema stipulates this  model (and
      tagging used to control it, i.e. a tag interface) but does not enforce any of the constraints
      so declared. Developers should take note that these constraints are all readily testable in
      XPath.</p>

        <p>The OSCAL validation model supports not only validation against a formal schema
          (describing elements, attributes, and their permitted contents, described generally and
          generically), but also against a set of declarations provided specifically for the catalog
          or catalog type within which they appear. Constraints described in these declarations, and
          bound via assignments of <code>@class</code> (for information within controls or
          components) and <code>@context</code> (indicating control, subcontrol, component or part
          wherein the given object may appear), enable automated checking for consistency of
          controls, subcontrols, components and their parts, specific to the types or kinds of
          control items that appear within a particular catalog or framework.</p>

      <p>Constraints applicable to a class or classes of <code>prop</code> elements (properties) in
          context</p>
      </part>
      <part class="remarks">
        <p>The class of properties, in context, to which the constraints apply, is indicated on the
            <code>@class</code> of the declaration (<code>declare-prop</code>). Only elements named
            <code>prop</code> with matching <code>@class</code> are subject to the declared
          constraints. The context is defined by the class of the element parent of the candidate
          property, whether it is a <code>control</code>, <code>subcontrol</code>, <code>part</code>
          or <code>group</code>. So a <code>declare-prop context="myControl" class="myProp"</code>
          will apply to any property (<code>prop</code> element) with class <q>myProp</q>, appearing
          in a control, subcontrol, part or group with class <q>myControl</q>.</p>
        <p>The constraints that will apply to these properties are indicated by the elements
          contained in the declaration. For example, a property declared as a <q>required
            singleton</q> is required to appear in its context (the validator will produce an error
          when it is missing), while it may not appear more than once (the validator will produce an
          error if more than one appear together).</p>
        <p>Because the <code>@class</code> attribute is the basis of the OSCAL declarations model,
          it is recommended that applications restrict the usage of this attribute to single name
          values, when used on controls or their compo. Although overloading <code>@class</code>, as
          it is frequently overloaded in HTML, is not forbidden in OSCAL and may even work in an
          OSCAL application, restricting elements to have <em>at most</em>, a single class
          assignment, will help keep things clean and intelligible.</p>
        <p>On declarations including <code>declare-prop</code> and its siblings, however, both
            <code>@class</code> and <code>@context</code> may be overloaded (multiple values). A
          helpful application will detect where there are conflicting declarations, meaning the same
          class designator is claimed by different elements in a given context.</p>

        <p>Indicates that a value or text within a value should be inherited from a property on a

      </part>
      <part class="remarks">
        <p><code>inherit</code> is typically used to enforce hierarchical numbering within control
          objects. When given in a <code>value</code> in a declaration, <code>inherit</code>
          indicates that the value of a property, or a segment of its value, must be the same as a
          property (<code>prop</code>) higher in the containment hierarchy of a control object. That
          is, if a property with <code>@class='number'</code> is constrained with
            <code>value/inherit</code>, it must be the same as is assigned on the closest ancestor
            (<code>part</code>, <code>subcontrol</code>, <code>control</code>, or
          <code>group</code>) with the given property.</p>
        <p>Usually, <code>inherit</code> is used in conjunction with <code>autonum</code>. Using the
          two elements in combination, for example, the number (property) assigned to a subcontrol
          appearing inside a control numbered <q>A1</q> may be constrained to be <q>A1-a</q>,
            <q>A1-b</q>, etc., depending on the position of the subcontrol within the control.</p>
        <p>If a value must inherit from a property of a different class from the containing control
          object, <code>inherit/@from</code> can be used to indicate the applicable property (by its
          class). By default, <code>inherit</code> indicates a property value should match an
          ancestor's property with the same <code>@class</code> (the most usual case).</p>

    <p>Prose may ordinarily appear anywhere in a control, subcontrol, or part, or at a higher level.
      OSCAL prose elements echo HTML semantics, although they are deliberately and specifically a

    <title>Developer notes and rationales</title>
      <ul>
        <li>We need XML, because we have peculiar functional requirements in dealing with arbitrary
        but semi-regular mixed data, specifically "documentary" contents; this is XML’s sweet
        spot.</li>
        <li>Syntactically, it would be good to use something as close to MicroXML as possible (we
        want Python programmers to want to write against this).</li>
        <li>Despite this discipline (or because of it) the XML stack is useful because it is
          available, performant for our purposes, and standards-based.</li>
        <li>We can aim for the widest distributed support via XSD for validation (for ubiquity of
        tools) but perform modeling work in RNC (flexibility) as long as possible (and perhaps
        provide/support other validation methodologies?) <ul>
          <li>Schema maintenance is going to require tools support anyway; we may as well start
            early: so RNC + docs =&gt; [XSD+docs] where all three are available as resources (you
            are reading the 'docs') to both human and machine consumers.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Provide for customization by restriction, not extension. Flavors of OSCAL will take the
        form of particular usages, not of formal schemas. <ul>
          <li>Ergo, no schema extension mechanism is called for – much less yet another one. If we
            need schema extension we can show how without a new metalanguage. A sufficiently simple
            schema should permit this.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Accordingly the element set should be as minimal as possible for now - minimum to get
        the job done (we can aim for decoration later).</li>
        <li>This implies that semantic modeling (of "control types" in different catalogs) work
        predominantly via a microformat mechanism (semantics overlaid on generic element types via a
        class mechanism) <ul>
          <li>This was prototyped and found to work (see below)</li>
          <li>An optional layer (the OSCAL Declarations layer) is implicit so we built one out as a
            POC.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Standing something up quickly and changing names as we go gives us a chance to try
        things on, not just debate principles.</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Controls, not (only) the documents that describe them</title>
      <p>OSCAL is a domain-specific language for the description and specification of collections of
        security and privacy controls in a control catalog. Inevitably there is a metaphysical grey
        zone between controls and the language by which they are defined and described. OSCAL
        attempts to normalize the semantics used to describe controls by providing a single format
        for which multiple control catalogs (e.g., NIST SP 800-53/53a, ISO/IEC 27001/2, COBIT 5) can
        be expressed. It does this by presenting a generalized descriptive "slate" or "tablet" upon
        which the particular patterns of a particular catalog, may be drawn. Not all catalogs in
        OSCAL will be the same – the design of controls in different catalogs and of different kinds
        and species, may be different – but because they will all be OSCAL, it will be easier to see
        their differences, easier to relate them to one another, and easier to do similar things in
        similar ways.</p>
      <p>Not only controls information itself, but a set of structured documents that describes and
        makes reference to such controls is in scope for OSCAL. Baselines, profiles, overlays and
        frameworks written in reference to controls catalogs, are all capabilities we aim to offer
        and support.</p>
</section><section>      <title>Validation</title>
      <p>In order to enable catalog and profile-specific validation, we have developed an
        alternative validation model. It is intended to be (third) complementary to the (two)
        predominant strategies for XML validation, namely validation against a grammar-based schema
        such as XSD or RNG) and validation per document or instance type (defined loosely) using
        query-based technologies such as Schematron. This additional validation model, called "OSCAL
        declarations", provides support for another "document level" validation layer, without
        having to code a Schematron. A small language (taking the form of a set of OSCAL tags)
        permits the specification of simple constraints that can be enforced over catalogs, profiles
        or worksheets. Much of the complexity that OSCAL must support moves away from the base
        schema, permitting it to be simpler, defining a smaller base tag set.</p>
      <p>Yet enriching this tagging to carry more semantics (appropriate to either a catalog type or
        its application or implementation) is nonetheless straightforward: a matter (as always) of
        defining and enforcing rules. But instead of requiring schema aggregation, modification or
        or extension, we now describe an "application usage" of OSCAL elements and class values
        (much like an HTML/CSS microformat). OSCAL declarations gives a way of exposing
        (documenting) and enforcing this set of constraints on document structures such that they
        can be enforced by automated means at runtime (when exceptions to stated rules can be
        detected). Thus developers and users have the capability to define OSCAL control types
        without having to write any schema code.</p>
  </section><section>
      <title>Relationship to other document formats</title>
      <p>OSCAL captures chunks of transcribed natural/literate/technical language, i.e. "prose", but
        it also permits the rational arrangement of such chunks of language with more tightly
        controlled values (control properties and parameters). Applied systematically and at scale,
        such regular and rational arrangements enable higher-order transparencies that can translate
        directly into functionalities (relating to data creation, manipulation, management and
        forensics). In this, OSCAL goes further than documentary-description XML formats such as the
        National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS), the
        NISO Standard Tag Set (STS), the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA), and other
        viable alternatives for encoding <q>control catalogs</q> in the broad sense. This is not
        because OSCAL provides a <q>semantics</q> for <q>controls</q> so much as because a means by
        which an OSCAL application (or user or developer) may do so. Accordingly, it is expected
        that OSCAL would be complementary to any of the formats just mentioned.</p></section>
