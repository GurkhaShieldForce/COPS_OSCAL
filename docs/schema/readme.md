# OSCAL schema documentation

This subdirectory contains [documentation, in OSCAL XML format](oscal-oscal.xml), of the OSCAL schema and related resources such as Schematron constraint sets.

See an [OSCAL Tag Library](oscal-tag-library.md) (element definitions) in this subdirectory, produced from that file. Currently, only elements are described; TBD are attribute definitions along with more background and perhaps examples.

The publication versions of the OSCAL schemas may be found in the [schema/XML](../../schema/XML) directory.
