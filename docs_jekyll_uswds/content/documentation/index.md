Before explaining what OSCAL is, it is important to define three key OSCAL terms:

- **Control:** A safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security and/or privacy requirements. While this is based on the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 definition of "control", in the context of OSCAL it refers to a similar kind of requirement from a control catalog.
- **Catalog:** A set of security control definitions. Examples include the hundreds of controls in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Appendix F, the 100+ controls in ISO 27002, and the practices in COBIT 5.
- **Profile:** A set of security requirements, where meeting each requirement necessitates implementing one or more security controls. Also called a baseline or overlay. Examples include the control baselines in NIST SP 800-53, the FedRAMP baselines, and the PCI DSS requirements.

## Purpose

OSCAL is attempting to address a number of challenges around security controls and security control assessment. The core challenge, and one of the primary reasons for creating OSCAL, is that concepts like security controls and profiles are represented today largely in proprietary ways. In many cases they are written in prose documents that are imprecise, lead to differences in interpretation, and are not machine-readable, meaning that the prose instructions require someone to do data entry into a tool in order for the tool to use the information.

Organizations are also struggling with information systems that have many different components. Some components require the use of different profiles per component; this is commonly the case with cloud environments. Also, cloud environments can be multitenant or have mixed ownership of components. We need to be able to assess the security of these systems against a number of requirements, owners, etc.—to do that simultaneously and provide these views to stakeholders.

On top of that there are situations where a single system needs to support multiple regulatory frameworks. For example, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is a federal agency (Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and NIST Cybersecurity Framework requirements) and a healthcare institution (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements) that has credit card transactions (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)). There is no shortage of requirements for some organizations that have multiple regulatory frameworks.

Assessing all these security controls is extremely complex. Because of that complexity, it’s largely a manual process today. The OSCAL project is trying to change that by standardizing how security controls are represented, how a control implementation for a given system is represented, and how that information is best used and reports generated in a standardized way that can be used by both humans and machines. That means formats are needed that can be generated by machines for communicating with other machines, but can also easily be reformatted so humans can read the information. By standardizing the representation of this information, OSCAL information can be interoperable by having a well-defined specification with information that’s going to be used, imported, and used interoperably for security control assessments. The goal is to keep OSCAL as simple as possible and provide extensive automation for tools to use.

## Users

The initial OSCAL work encompasses the catalog and profile concepts. There are several types of users who should benefit from OSCAL catalogs and profiles. They include the following producers of OSCAL catalogs, profiles, and/or tools:

- **Catalog maintainers:** publishing catalogs into OSCAL format (e.g., NIST, ISO, ISACA)
- **Standard profile maintainers:** profiles in OSCAL format used by many organizations consuming OSCAL catalogs (e.g., NIST, FedRAMP)
- **Custom profile maintainers:** developing new profiles or customizing existing profiles for organization-specific use (e.g., cloud service providers, integrators)
- **Tool vendors:** creating tools that use OSCAL to support risk assessment, continuous monitoring, compliance reporting, and other purposes

There are also several types of expected consumers of OSCAL catalogs, profiles, and/or tools, including the following:

- **Operations personnel:** rapidly verifying that systems comply with organizational security requirements
- **Security and privacy personnel:** automatically identifying problems and addressing them quickly before loss or damage occur
- **Auditors/assessors:** performing audits/assessments on demand with minimal effort
- **Policy personnel:** identifying systemic problems that necessitate changes to organization security policy

## Components

The plans for OSCAL involve all the components depicted in the following diagram:

Starting from the bottom on the left, the OSCAL components are:

- **Catalog/Framework:** In addition to defining a set of security controls, it may also define objectives and methods for assessing the controls (e.g., NIST SP 800-53A). Combining assessment objectives and methods with security controls has been done because some control catalog formats, such as COBIT 5, address assessment information directly. Others have it separately, like 800-53A. Including assessment objectives within the OSCAL catalog model simplifies the entire OSCAL operational model.
- **Profile:** The profile format will allow for selecting security controls using a number of different mechanisms as well as tailoring those controls (e.g., assigning parameter values, modifying requirements). A profile can include controls from more than one catalog, so an organization could have a single profile that references controls from several catalogs.
- **Implementation:** Defines how each profile item is implemented for a given system component. This can represent a machine-readable system security plan in OSCAL format. It will also support transforms from the machine-readable form to a human-readable version.
- **Assessment:** Describes how the system assessment is to be performed.
- **Assessment Results:** Records the findings of the assessment.

These are the current definitions for each component. As the project progresses, these definitions may evolve. They are included here to indicate the overall body of work for OSCAL and not the finalized details of each component.

This is an explanation of the basic constructs supported by OSCAL. These constructs exist in all OSCAL bindings (e.g., XML, JSON). At this time, the material covers OSCAL controls, catalogs, and profiles. Additional OSCAL constructs will be added as they are developed and mature.

## Controls

In OSCAL, a control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security and/or privacy requirements. The definitions of controls vary greatly from one standard or guideline to another in terms of the level of detail and the types of information the definitions include. A control definition may be as simple as, "The organization has an access control policy and procedures," but most are considerably more complicated. Here's an example of a control from NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4:

<img src="/assets/img/NIST-SP-800-53-Rev4-AC1.png" alt="800-53Rev4AC1" width="800" />

This control has seven high-level components, including a security control identifier ("AC-1"), a title ("ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES"), the control itself, supplemental guidance, control enhancements, references, and a priority and baseline allocation. Now look at a similar excerpt of ISO 27002 on access control policy. It is even more detailed, with an identifier ("9.1.1"), a title ("Access control policy"), control text, lengthy implementation guidance, and other information (additional advice on access control policy).

<img src="/assets/img/ISO-27002-Control-9.1.1.png" alt="ISO27002911" width="800" />

Comparing the ISO 27002 and NIST SP 800-53 examples show obvious differences. NIST SP 800-53 includes several components, such as references, control enhancements, and priority, that ISO 27002 does not. NIST SP 800-53's statement of the control itself is also much more detailed and specific than ISO 27002's, because ISO 27002 provides those details in its implementation guidance instead of the control text. There are other differences in terminology as well, such as NIST SP 800-53 using the term "supplemental guidance" for roughly what ISO 27002 calls "other information".

OSCAL is designed to take disparate control definitions from different sources and express them in a standardized way using its control element.

## Catalogs

An OSCAL catalog is a set of closely related OSCAL controls. The catalog for NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4 defines all NIST SP 800-53 controls. There would be a separate catalog for the controls from ISO 27002. An OSCAL catalog may simply define controls, or it may also organize those controls. Sections can be defined to partition a catalog, with each section containing one or more references to controls or control groups. A group references related controls or control groups.

## Profiles
An OSCAL profile is a set of security requirements, where meeting each requirement necessitates implementing one or more security controls. Also called a baseline or overlay, examples of profiles include the control baselines in NIST SP 800-53, the FedRAMP baselines, and the PCI DSS requirements.

The figure below is an example of what OSCAL is doing with catalogs and profiles. This example represents the NIST SP 800-53 low baseline, which is a profile in OSCAL nomenclature. The profile is effectively indicating which controls from the NIST SP 800-53 catalog are required to be compliant with the profile (NIST SP 800-53 low baseline). Using OSCAL formats for these makes the mappings between the control catalog and the profile explicit and machine readable. A single profile can reference controls in multiple catalogs. OSCAL will allow profiles to be generated using the same interoperable format regardless of which catalogs are being used.
