We are excited that you want to learn more about the OSCAL project! The OSCAL community is a collaborative environment of professionals that contribute to the project goals and objectives. The community is setting out to develop a “standard of standards” that normalizes the representation of system security controls and corresponding information. The focus is to improve security assessment efficiency, accuracy and consistency. The community agrees that the language must be well defined and easy to use for both human and machine-readable formats. The consumers audience includes those that implement, review and maintain the security posture of a system.

The intended audience for OSCAL consists of producers and consumers. Overview and roadmap information is customized based upon the user audience. The defintiion of the audiences are included below. 

Select [Producer](Producer.md) or [Consumer](Consumer.md) to continue and learn more about the project.

The producers include those producing catalogs, profiles and tools using the OSCAL format. Additional details for producers include:

 - Catalog maintainers publish catalogs into OSCAL format (e.g., NIST, ISO, ISACA).

- Standard profile maintainers maintain profiles in OSCAL format used by many organizations consuming OSCAL catalogs (for example, NIST, FedRAMP).

- Custom profile maintainers develop new profiles or customize existing profiles for organization-specific use (for example, cloud service providers, integrators).

- Tool vendors create tools that use OSCAL to support risk assessment, continuous monitoring, compliance reporting, and other purposes.

The consumers include those that implement, review and maintain the security posture of a system. A sample of consumers include: operations personnel, security and privacy personnel, auditors/assessors, policy personnel and system owners.
