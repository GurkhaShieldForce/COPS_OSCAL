## What is OSCAL?

NIST is leading a project to develop a standard assessment that may be applied to a system to increase its security posture. The project is the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). The OSCAL project is focused on challenges centered around security controls and security controls assessment. Security controls and profiles are represented in proprietary ways and are expressed in prose format rather than being machine readable. The current environment leads to imprecise implementation, differences in interpretation and requires manual effort to implement the controls. A fundamental element of the project is to move the security control and profile from a text-based approach to a standardized automated format. This moves the implementation of security to a machine-based approach rather than a manual-based approach. Automated profiles reduce time and skills required for preparation of security audits.

Multiple information system components, the hosting environment and the necessity to meet multiple regulatory requirements contribute to the complexity of security assessment. The security of systems needs to be checked against a number of requirements, owners and done simultaneously and continuously to provide value to system stakeholders.

Providing a complete assessment is complex and due to that complexity, assessments are largely a manual process.

Streamlining and standardizing security assessment decreases assessment-related labor, provides the ability to assess system security continuously, provides the capability to assess system compliance against multiple sets of requirements simultaneously.

## Why OSCAL?

We are excited that you want to learn more about OSCAL. The OSCAL community is a collaborative environment of professionals that contribute to the project goals and objectives. The community is setting out to develop a “standard of standards” that normalizes the representation of system security controls and corresponding information. The focus is to improve security assessment efficiency, accuracy and consistency. The community agrees that the language must be well defined and easy to use for both human and machine-readable formats.

Once the standards are defined, tools that use the OSCAL information will be developed in partnership with commercial vendors. The tools that use OSCAL information must be inter-operable and use the information consistently. Partnerships are important to the success of the project. Through project partnerships, an emphasis is to demonstrate the value for developers to adopt OSCAL so tools are available for organizations to build, customize, and use the framework.

## OSCAL Concepts

https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/concepts/

The terms associated with the project are important to understand. Three terms encompass the foundation for the project. Those terms are: Catalog, Profile and Control.

The catalog layer is a set of security control definitions. Examples include the hundreds of controls in NIST SP 800-53, the 100+ controls in ISO 27002, and the practices in COBIT 5.

The profile layer is a set of security requirements; also called a baseline or overlay. Examples include the control baselines in NIST SP 800-53, the FedRAMP baselines, and the PCI DSS requirements.

Control is another term associated with the foundation of the project. The control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security requirements. [based on NIST SP 800-53 definition]. Models for representing a security control catalog in a common OSCAL format are developed. The control catalog is a collection of controls.

The project is standardizing the terminology used between the various catalogs.
