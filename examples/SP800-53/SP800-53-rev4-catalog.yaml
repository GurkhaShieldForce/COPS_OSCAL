          the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
          in the AC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - '<p>Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared,
          group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor,
          temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed
          above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification
          of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access
          privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security
          plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts
          receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g.,
          system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer)
          responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations
          may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by
          type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for
          authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week,
          and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations
          consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system
          upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences,
          customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure
          to consider these factors could affect information system availability.
          Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use.
          Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation
          procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand
          for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts
          in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation.
          Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization
          processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with
          infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special
          tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable).
          Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling
          or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include,
          for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are
          no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.
          Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.</p>'

        - class: guidance
          prose:
          - <p>In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ
            static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges,
            dynamic access control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures)
            rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege
            management. While user identities may remain relatively constant over
            time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission/business
            requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
            management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges
            from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their
            sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management
            can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based
            on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type
            of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of
            privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if
            information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations.
            This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege
            changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for
            communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements
            for information system resiliency.</p>

          prose:
          - <p>Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is
            synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained
            only to certain historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula
            Model). The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains
            what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects
            for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects
            from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This
            class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions
            subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges;
            that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other
            subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects
            to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control
            policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via
            an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25).
            The policy is bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the
            information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional
            means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information
            remain in effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges
            consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects
            are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary
            for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most
            applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order,
            directive, or regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to
            sensitive/classified information and some users of the information system
            are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified information resident
            in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with
            AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed
            by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints
            of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over
            the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory
            access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing
            information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label,
            AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with
            the same sensitivity label as the subject.</p>

          - <p>When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects
            are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information
            for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have
            been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e.,
            the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects
            or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3
            (3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed
            by AC-3 (3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints
            of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3 (3) imposes constraints
            preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating
            at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass
            the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy
            is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is
            passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means
            may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While
            the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control
            require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required
            for this use of discretionary access control.</p>

          prose:
          - <p>Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that restricts
            information system access to authorized users. Organizations can create
            specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges)
            to perform needed operations on organizational information systems associated
            with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the organizational
            roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those
            roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because
            privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant
            number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead
            acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a
            mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations implementing
            RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3 (3) define
            the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.</p>

          - <p>Information systems can only protect organizational information within
            the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards
            may be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected
            once it is passed beyond the established information system boundaries.
            Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting
            information to an external information system or printing the information
            on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable
            to make a determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by
            entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations
            determine procedurally whether the external information systems are providing
            adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the security
            provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting
            inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization
            and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used
            by external entities to protect the information received need not be the
            same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient
            to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the
            information. This control enhancement requires information systems to
            employ technical or procedural means to validate the information prior
            to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the information system
            passes information to another system controlled by another organization,
            technical means are employed to validate that the security attributes
            associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving
            system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to
            a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed
            to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to
            the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable when there is
            some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation)
            that establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that
            policy applies beyond the realm of a particular information system or
            organization.</p>

      - class: guidance
        prose:
        - '<p>Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
          within an information system and between information systems (as opposed
          to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard
          to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include,
          for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted
          in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be
          from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that
          are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers
          between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring
          information between information systems representing different security
          domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers
          violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information
          owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points
          between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
          architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.
          Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers
          between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing
          hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and (iii) implementing
          trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security
          labels. Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies
          and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated
          sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within
          information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is
          based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.
          Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways,
          routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or
          establish configuration settings that restrict information system services,
          provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering
          capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches
          or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness
          of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software
          components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements
          3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on
          more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow
          enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example,
          high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in
          commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.</p>'

            data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone number). Enforcing allowed
            information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more effective
            flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with
            regard to data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are
            correct with respect to the data), data integrity (i.e., protecting against
            unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding of metadata to
            the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques

            can check for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file
            types (for structured and unstructured data). Security policy filters
            for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word
            filters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content.
            Structured data permits the interpretation of data content by applications.
            Unstructured data typically refers to digital information without a particular
            data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate the development

          in contrast to SC-10 which addresses the termination of network connections
          that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect).
          A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever
          a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational
          information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate
          user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates
          all processes associated with a user�s logical session except those processes
          that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue
          after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring
          automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined
          periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents,
          time-of-day restrictions on information system use.</p>

        - <p>This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that
          no identification or authentication is required in organizational information
          systems. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without
          identification or authentication including, for example, when individuals
          access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information
          systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles
          are received. Organizations also identify actions that normally require
          identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g.,
          emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed.
          Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch
          that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental
          or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification
          and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather
          to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred.
          Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed
          on organizational information systems without identification and authentication
          and thus, the values for assignment statements can be none.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Information is represented internally within information systems using
          abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent
          different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also
          known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or
          processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known
          as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records,
          buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security
          attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic
          properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect
          to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active
          entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information,
          to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information
          system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities
          (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of
          security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and
          is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute
          type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement
          of information security policies for access control and information flow
          control, either through organizational processes or information system functions
          or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can
          directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.
          Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information
          systems to support missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide
          range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release
          markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable
          to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values,
          organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful
          and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security
          attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures
          within organizational information systems, to enable information system-based
          enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include, for
          example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption
          and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification
          of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The
          term security marking refers to the association of security attributes with
          objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based
          enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents
          the requirement for user-based attribute association (marking). The enhancements
          to AC-16 represent additional requirements including information system-based
          attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include, for example,
          classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level
          for subjects. An example of a value for both of these attribute types is
          Top Secret.</p>

        - <p>Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users
          (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external
          networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example,
          dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual
          private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote
          connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;
          however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security
          controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality
          and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization
          that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks.  Still,
          VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not
          enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted
          tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network
          communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply
          to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed
          for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing
          remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While
          organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote
          access connections, such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing
          access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3.</p>

        prose:
        - '<p>A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor
          such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed
          to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive
          information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage;
          and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also
          include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the
          device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
          local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers,
          and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual
          and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual; however,
          the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size
          of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the
          mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems,
          depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the
          large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics
          and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different
          classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation
          guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management,
          device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective
          software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for
          malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical
          software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly
          other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware
          (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to
          provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements
          in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices
          are reflected in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the
          initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security
          plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree
          of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security controls within
          the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that
          are not organization-controlled.</p>'

        - '<p>External information systems are information systems or components of
          information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established
          by organizations and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision
          and authority over the application of required security controls or the
          assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include,
          for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook
          computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii) privately
          owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public
          facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls,
          or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal
          governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are
          not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority
          of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external information
          systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational information,
          including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as
          a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational
          information systems. For some external information systems (i.e., information
          systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate
          to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between
          those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no
          explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these
          organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when,
          for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit
          or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate
          to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals
          include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals
          with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which
          organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard
          to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals
          need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust
          relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose
          to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state,
          local, or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of
          external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational
          information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through
          www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of
          external information systems in accordance with organizational security
          policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types
          of applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems
          from external information systems; and the highest security category of
          information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information
          systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information
          systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on
          organizational personnel using those external systems.</p>'

          prose:
          - <p>In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access
            control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such
            instances, authorization information is transmitted securely so timely
            access control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations.
            To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit
            as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes.
            This is due to the fact that in distributed information systems, there
            are various access control decisions that need to be made and different
            entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion, each
            requiring some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access
            authorization information (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that
            such information cannot be altered, spoofed, or otherwise compromised
            during transmission.</p>

      - class: guidance
        prose:
        - <p>Information is represented internally within information systems using
          abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent
          different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also
          known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or
          processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known
          as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records,
          buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Reference
          monitors typically enforce mandatory access control policies�a type of access
          control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of subjects
          or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory
          because subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are
          restricted from passing those privileges on to any other subjects, either
          directly or indirectly�that is, the information system strictly enforces
          the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy.
          The tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from
          compromising the functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property
          prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and hence violating the
          security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the completeness
          in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies
          (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security
          policy.</p>

          based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the
          specific security requirements of organizations and the information systems
          to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide
          enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers,
          acquisition/procurement officials, information system managers, system/network
          administrators, personnel conducting configuration management and auditing
          activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation
          activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access
          to system-level software, adequate security-related technical training specifically
          tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based training addresses
          management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering
          physical, personnel, and technical safeguards and countermeasures. Such
          training can include for example, policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts
          for the organizational security roles defined. Organizations also provide
          the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities
          related to operations and supply chain security within the context of organizational
          information security programs. Role-based security training also applies
          to contractors providing services to federal agencies.</p>

            of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email,
            receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an
            email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor
            or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to such suspicious
            email or web communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking
            on embedded web links, and checking the source of email addresses). For
            this process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained

          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information
          system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant
          and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments
          in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit
          needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons,
          or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege
          usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining
          the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate
          for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing
          requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires
          identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given
          point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information
          systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful
          and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances
          due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements,
          including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security
          controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable
          events that are required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
          policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at
          various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information
          traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is
          a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification
          of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of
          auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as
          the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that
          are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in
          service-oriented architectures.</p>

          prose:
          - <p>This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the
            generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather,
            the enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise
            produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit information.
            Security Event and Information Management System tools can facilitate
            audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system
            components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of
            standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations
            (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective
            approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation
            of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is
            important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating
            attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance
            data can help uncover denial of service attacks or cyber attacks resulting
            in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information
            can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information
            to operational situations.</p>

            documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment
            incidents, improper use of organizational information assets). Such information
            can lead organizations to a more directed analytical effort to detect
            potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive nature of the
            information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access
            to such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release
            of privacy-related information to individuals that do not have a need
            to know. Thus, correlation of information from nontechnical sources with
            audit information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected
            of being involved in a security incident. Organizations obtain legal advice
            prior to initiating such actions.</p>

          provided by the information system can generate customizable reports. Time
          ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity

          Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern
          continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset
          from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization
          between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks
          synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds.
          Organizations may define different time granularities for different system
          components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities
          such as access control and identification and authentication, depending
          on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.</p>

          that requested particular services across organizational boundaries may
          often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance
          ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational
          auditing (e.g., the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented
          architectures) simply captures the identity of individuals issuing requests
          at the initial information system, and subsequent systems record that the
          requests emanated from authorized individuals.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations

          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing

        - '<p>Organizations assess security controls in organizational information
          systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of:
          (i) initial and ongoing security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments;
          (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life cycle activities.
          Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into
          organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies
          early in the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed
          to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes;
          and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments
          are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F (main
          catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System
          Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can
          use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning
          and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems
          during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment
          results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine
          the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls
          are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
          outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement
          for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional
          assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational
          security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided
          to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
          conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization
          decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official
          designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations
          can use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing
          information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii)   system
          development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment
          results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness,
          and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing
          security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the
          results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments
          as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB
          policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring.
          Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments
          in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Information
          Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability
          mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities
          such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.</p>'

          prose:
          - '<p>Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups
            who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems.
            Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual
            conflicts of interest with regard to the development, operation, or management
            of the organizational information systems under assessment or to the determination
            of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors
            should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations
            where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work;
            (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving;
            or (iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations
            acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from
            elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private
            sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine
            the required level of independence based on the security categories of
            information systems and/or the ultimate risk to organizational operations,
            organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine
            if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that
            the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions.
            This includes determining whether contracted security assessment services
            have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners
            are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence
            the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations,
            for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small
            or organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by
            individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management
            chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved
            by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed
            by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy,
            integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that
            assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to authorization
            decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient independence,
            more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need
            to repeat assessments.</p>'

        - <p>This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems
          (i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled
          connections such as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully
          consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected
          to other systems with different security requirements and security controls,
          both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials
          determine the risk associated with information system connections and the
          appropriate controls employed. If interconnecting systems have the same
          authorizing official, organizations do not need to develop Interconnection
          Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the interface characteristics
          between those interconnecting systems in their respective security plans.
          If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the
          same organization, organizations can either develop Interconnection Security
          Agreements or describe the interface characteristics between systems in
          the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations may also incorporate
          Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts, especially
          for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal
          (i.e., private sector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information
          systems sharing the same networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space,
          unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices), there may be specialized
          connections in place during preoperational testing. Such connections may
          require Interconnection Security Agreements and be subject to additional
          security controls.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed through
          authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or
          executives (i.e., authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information
          systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and
          assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation
          of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary
          oversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility
          for the mission/business operations supported by those systems. The security
          authorization process is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore,
          authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization
          process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable
          for security risks associated with the operation and use of organizational
          information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in positions
          with levels of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such
          information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations
          conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous
          monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year
          reauthorization requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are
          not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring
          processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e.,
          security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones)
          is updated on an ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information
          system owners with an up-to-date status of the security state of organizational
          information systems and environments of operation.  To reduce the administrative
          cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results
          of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the
          basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.</p>

        - <p>Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
          vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk
          management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations
          assess/analyze security controls and information security-related risks
          at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions.
          The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk
          response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow
          organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information systems
          and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation
          with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies.
          Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through
          reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make
          more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security
          authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security
          authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other
          system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring
          outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable,
          actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled
          in accordance with the security categories of information systems.</p>

        prose:
        - '<p>Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on
          information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities
          that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either
          validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance organizational
          information systems have to adversaries within a set of specified constraints
          (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to
          duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks
          against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-related
          weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the results of vulnerability
          analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing
          can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an
          information system and can exercise both physical and technical security
          controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example:
          (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii)
          pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis;
          and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.
          All parties agree to the rules of engagement before the commencement of
          penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration testing
          rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are
          anticipated to be employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational
          risk assessments guide decisions on the level of independence required for
          personnel conducting penetration testing.</p>'

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing

        prose:
        - <p>This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems
          and system components including communications and connectivity-related
          aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed
          and agreed-upon sets of specifications for information systems or configuration
          items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for
          future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline
          configurations include information about information system components (e.g.,
          standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers,
          servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers
          and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration
          settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those
          components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations
          requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change
          over time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current
          enterprise architecture.</p>

            configurations allow organizations to apply the configuration management
            that is most appropriate for each type of configuration. For example,
            management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need
            for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires
            greater flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the
            configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable
            so that the results of the testing are representative of the proposed

            (e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be located in high-risk
            areas, additional security controls may be implemented to counter the
            greater threat in such areas coupled with the lack of physical security
            relative to organizational-controlled areas. For example, organizational
            policies and procedures for notebook computers used by individuals departing

            are of concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring

            and applying specific safeguards to the device after travel is completed.
            Specially configured notebook computers include, for example, computers
            with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening
            (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied
            to mobile devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining
            the device for signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard
            disk drive. Protecting information residing on mobile devices is covered

          involve the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing,

          and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline
          configurations for components and configuration items of information systems,
          changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g.,
          operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices),
          unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.
          Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems
          include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed
          changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing
          major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development
          organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes includes
          activities before and after changes are made to organizational information
          systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.</p>

        - <p>Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of
          information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall
          security of the systems. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified
          and authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes of
          initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations
          maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is
          implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover
          any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include software
          libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical
          access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries,
          abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather
          than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes
          occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).</p>

        prose:
        - '<p>Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed
          in hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system
          that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Information
          technology products for which security-related configuration settings can
          be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database,
          electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations,
          input/output devices (e.g.,  scanners, copiers, and printers), network components
          (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access
          points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and
          applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting
          the security state of information systems including the parameters required
          to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters
          include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory
          permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols,
          services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
          configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information
          systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration
          baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration
          checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security
          technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established
          benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information
          technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information
          system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations
          can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information
          technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia,
          industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private
          sectors. Common secure configurations include the United States Government
          Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6
          and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation
          Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common
          Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify,
          track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy
          on configuration requirements for federal information systems.</p>'

        - <p>Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services.
          Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary
          to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).
          Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from
          single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting
          the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations
          limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email
          servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and
          services provided by information systems or individual components of information
          systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination
          (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and
          file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical
          and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol,
          and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized
          connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized
          tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection
          and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and
          host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of
          prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.</p>

        - <p>Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration
          management policies while being tailored to individual information systems.
          Such plans define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration
          management is used to support system development life cycle activities at
          the information system level. Configuration management plans are typically
          developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development
          life cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management
          processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain
          information system component inventories, how to control development, test,
          and operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key
          documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent
          and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans.
          Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for
          the organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system
          by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation
          of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed
          changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact
          analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration
          items are the information system items (hardware, software, firmware, and
          documentation) to be configuration-managed. As information systems continue
          through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be
          identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be
          under configuration control.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing

        prose:
        - <p>Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational
          program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.
          Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation
          of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised.
          The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such
          planning throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing
          contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can
          be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency
          plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information
          systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level
          of continuity of operations desired.  Information system recovery objectives
          reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards,
          regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system availability,
          contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in
          a reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious
          attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of information systems.
          Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful
          degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate
          information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are
          under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident
          handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency

            Critical information system assets include technical and operational aspects.
            Technical aspects include, for example, information technology services,
            information system components, information technology products, and mechanisms.
            Operational aspects include, for example, procedures (manually executed

            and/or executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection

          of any interim information system capabilities that may have been needed
          during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of
          fully restored information system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous
          monitoring activities, potential information system reauthorizations, and
          activities to prepare the systems against future disruptions, compromises,
          or failures. Recovery/reconstitution capabilities employed by organizations
          can include both automated mechanisms and manual procedures.</p>

        - <p>This control supports information system resiliency and contingency planning/continuity
          of operations. To ensure mission/business continuity, organizations can
          implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms
          may be less effective than the primary mechanisms (e.g., not as easy to
          use, not as scalable, or not as secure). However, having the capability
          to readily employ these alternative/supplemental mechanisms enhances overall
          mission/business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if
          organizational operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of
          implementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort
          required to provide such alternative capabilities, this control would typically
          be applied only to critical security capabilities provided by information
          systems, system components, or information system services. For example,
          an organization may issue to senior executives and system administrators
          one-time pads in case multifactor tokens, the organization�s standard means
          for secure remote authentication, is compromised.</p>

        - <p class="description">The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates
          organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).</p>
      - class: guidance
        prose:
        - '<p>Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations
          deem to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers).
          This control applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly
          identified and documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through
          authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication.
          Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group
          accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability
          of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics
          to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor authentication,
          or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems
          is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any
          access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting
          on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections
          without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational
          information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where
          such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses).
          Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through
          external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local
          area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted
          virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organization-controlled
          endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal
          networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity
          of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the identification
          and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the requirements
          in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific
          organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires
          the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The
          factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal
          identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic
          identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric).
          Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems
          gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based
          or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government
          Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common access card. In addition
          to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level
          (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication
          mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased
          information security. Identification and authentication requirements for
          other than organizational users are described in IA-8.</p>'

        - class: guidance
          prose:
          - <p>Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two separate
            communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an
            information system. The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to
            identify and authenticate users or devices, and generally is the path
            through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band
            path) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested
            action. For example, a user authenticates via a notebook computer to a
            remote server to which the user desires access, and requests some action
            of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the server contacts
            the user via the user�s cell phone to verify that the requested action
            originated from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action
            to an individual on the telephone or provide an authentication code via
            the telephone. This type of authentication can be employed by organizations
            to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The conditions
            for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat
            indicators or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification
            level of information in requested transactions.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification
          and authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination
          of type/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information
          (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
          Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational
          authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication
          Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication,
          Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks.
          Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms
          by the security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges
          of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to
          only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that
          truly need to support this capability.</p>

        - <p>Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control
          (MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers.
          Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information
          system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically, individual
          identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned
          to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities
          of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses
          individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system
          accounts (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases
          accessed by badge reader systems for access to information systems). Preventing
          reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used
          individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals,
          groups, roles, or devices.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics,
          PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual
          content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator
          content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship
          information system components with factory default authentication credentials
          to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
          credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant
          security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may
          be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession
          of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators
          stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored
          in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords
          accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual
          authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions
          for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum
          password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous
          one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification
          stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to
          safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of
          individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators
          with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately.
          Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed,
          authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance.
          Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.</p>

            in a similar manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators.
            This control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock
            hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity Verification cards).
            The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of the
            requirements in the enhancement. Cryptographically-protected passwords
            include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic
            hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number
            of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the
            current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary
            passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords,
            organizations may also consider salting passwords.</p>

            the authenticator to the information system. For example, the binding
            between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator)
            is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair
            in the information system. New authentication techniques allow the binding
            between the identity and the authenticator to be implemented outside an
            information system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity
            and the authenticator are bound together on the card. Using these credentials,
            information systems can authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned,
            dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations,
            organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished
            trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate
            identities and related credentials are essential.</p>

            negatives when making such comparisons. The rate at which the false accept

          For some types of information systems or system components, for example,
          desktops/notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (often referred
          to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or
          components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat
          may be less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased
          likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore,
          the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly.
          Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example,
          displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or displaying
          feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.</p>

          this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques/mechanisms and
          establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior (e.g., individuals accessing
          information that they do not typically access as part of their normal duties,
          roles, or responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information
          than the individuals would routinely access, or attempting to access information
          from suspicious network addresses). In these situations when certain preestablished
          conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require selected individuals
          to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use
          for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase the strength
          of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being accessed.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing

        - <p>Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent
          on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business
          processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider
          incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of
          mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information
          can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit
          monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator
          reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability
          includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for
          example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing
          officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices,
          legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk
          executive (function).</p>

        - <p>Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive
          information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not
          authorized to process such information. Such information spills often occur
          when information that is initially thought to be of lower sensitivity is
          transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined
          to be of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required.
          The nature of the organizational response is generally based upon the degree
          of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security category or classification
          level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific
          nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g.,
          security clearances) of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated
          system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after
          the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill
          to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such
          contamination is isolated and eradicated.</p>

        - <p>Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information
          sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers,
          implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat
          in order to implement defensive measures that will enable organizations
          to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid detection
          of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment
          of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected,
          the integrated security analysis team can rapidly develop an appropriate
          response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information
          on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development. This enables
          the team to identify adversary TTPs that are linked to the operations tempo
          or to specific missions/business functions, and to define responsive actions
          in a way that does not disrupt the mission/business operations. Ideally,
          information security analysis teams are distributed within organizations
          to make the capability more resilient.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

          copiers, and printers. Information necessary for creating effective maintenance
          records includes, for example: (i) date and time of maintenance; (ii) name
          of individuals or group performing the maintenance; (iii) name of escort,
          if necessary; (iv) a description of the maintenance performed; and (v) information
          system components/equipment removed or replaced (including identification
          numbers, if applicable). The level of detail included in maintenance records
          can be informed by the security categories of organizational information
          systems. Organizations consider supply chain issues associated with replacement
          components for information systems.</p>'

          activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present
          at the information system or information system component and not communicating
          across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment
          of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access
          requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators
          that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication.
          Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored
          on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing
          requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.</p>

          protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical plant
          maintenance personnel). Technical competence of supervising individuals
          relates to the maintenance performed on the information systems while having
          required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems.
          Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel,
          such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators,
          and consultants, may require privileged access to organizational information
          systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities with
          little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations
          may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials
          may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.</p>

          prose:
          - <p>Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to
            evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous
            (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance
            is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance
            activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance
            within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance
            stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's
            condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process control
            to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be
            appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while
            equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system
            operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings
            and higher system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include
            measurement of the item. To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance
            utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared, acoustic
            (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration
            analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online
            tests.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing

        - <p>The term security marking refers to the application/use of human-readable
          security attributes. The term security labeling refers to the application/use
          of security attributes with regard to internal data structures within information
          systems (see AC-16). Information system media includes both digital and
          non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic
          tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks,
          and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper
          and microfilm. Security marking is generally not required for media containing
          information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to
          be publicly releasable. However, some organizations may require markings
          for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable.
          Marking of information system media reflects applicable federal laws, Executive
          Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.</p>

          Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically
          controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting inventories,
          ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return
          media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored
          media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet,
          or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate
          with the security category and/or classification of the information residing
          on the media. Controlled areas are areas for which organizations provide
          sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established
          for protecting information and/or information systems. For media containing
          information determined by organizations to be in the public domain, to be
          publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on organizations
          or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel, fewer safeguards
          may be needed. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate
          protection.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media.
          Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
          hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
          Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
          also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
          smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled
          areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide
          sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements
          established for protecting information and/or information systems. Physical
          and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category
          or classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to
          protect media during transport include, for example, locked containers and
          cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity
          protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with
          transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such
          as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate
          transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and
          courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization
          (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service).
          Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example,
          restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or
          obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through
          the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.
          Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated
          with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational
          assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping
          methods for the different types of media transport as part of an overall
          system of transport-related records.</p>

        - <p>This control applies to all information system media, both digital and
          non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered
          removable. Examples include media found in scanners, copiers, printers,
          notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices.
          The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the
          information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques,
          including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent
          the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media
          is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate
          sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary
          when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations
          use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and
          procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain
          or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations
          or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital
          media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise
          unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document
          by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness
          to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the
          sanitization process for media containing classified information.</p>

          Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
          hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
          Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
          also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
          smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts
          user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of
          media on information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use
          of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical
          and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior)
          to restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict
          the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages
          on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling/removing
          the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may
          also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices
          including, for example, devices provided by the organization, devices provided
          by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned.
          Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices
          based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable,
          portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling
          or removing the capability to write to such devices.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - <p>This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals
          (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access
          authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Organizations determine
          the types of facility guards needed including, for example, professional
          physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff
          or information system users. Physical access devices include, for example,
          keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible
          areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras, monitoring
          by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components
          in secured areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable
          federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
          and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Program
          provides implementation guidance for identity, credential, and access management
          capabilities for physical access control systems. Organizations have flexibility
          in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural (e.g.,
          a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access
          occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some
          combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access
          points, interior access points to information systems and/or components
          requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational
          information systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be located in areas
          designated as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access
          to such devices.</p>

          in the PL family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - <p>Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls
          and control enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level,
          how the security controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements,
          but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design
          or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient
          information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment
          and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a
          design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent
          of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations
          and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan
          is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance
          to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253
          to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements,
          technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical,
          Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and
          Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing
          overlays. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be
          a collection of various documents including documents that already exist.
          Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures,
          and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications)
          where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation
          requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related
          information in other established management/operational areas related to
          enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering,
          and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency
          plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly
          or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished
          by those plans.</p>

          who simply receive data/information from federal information systems, is
          often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited
          nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for both
          organizational and non-organizational users can also be established in AC-8,
          System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed acknowledgment portion of this
          control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based
          security training programs conducted by organizations if such training includes
          rules of behavior. Organizations can use electronic signatures for acknowledging
          rules of behavior.</p>

        - <p>This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and
          development of information systems. The information security architecture
          at the individual information system level is consistent with and complements
          the more global, organization-wide information security architecture described
          in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture.
          The information security architecture includes an architectural description,
          the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls),
          security-related information for external interfaces, information being
          exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated
          with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can include
          other important security-related information, for example, user roles and
          access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the
          types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information
          system, restoration priorities of information and information system services,
          and any other specific protection needs. In today�s modern architecture,
          it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information
          resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information
          services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the information
          security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission/business
          protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining
          under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational
          information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective
          information security architecture. The development of the information security
          architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy
          (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed
          to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented.
          PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to
          help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture
          for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated
          with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide
          information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed
          at external information technology product/system developers and integrators
          (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house
          system development). SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected
          when organizations outsource the development of information systems or information
          system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show
          consistency with the organization�s enterprise architecture and information
          security architecture.</p>

          - <p>Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural,
            technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have
            to overcome multiple safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring
            adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult to successfully
            attack critical information resources (i.e., increases adversary work
            factor) and also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination
            of allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves
            one safeguard does not create adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout,
            cascading alarms) by interfering with another safeguard. Placement of
            security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality or information
            value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to
            place anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web
            servers, notebook computers, and workstations to maximize the number of
            related safeguards adversaries must penetrate before compromising the

          includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring
          the organization-defined, centrally managed security controls and processes.
          As central management of security controls is generally associated with
          common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization
          of security control implementations and management and judicious use of
          organizational resources.  Centrally-managed security controls and processes
          may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial
          and ongoing authorizations to operate as part of organizational continuous
          monitoring. As part of the security control selection process, organizations
          determine which controls may be suitable for central management based on
          organizational resources and capabilities. Organizations consider that it
          may not always be possible to centrally manage every aspect of a security
          control. In such cases, the security control is treated as a hybrid control
          with the control managed and implemented either centrally or at the information

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

          tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards,
          and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals
          understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and
          that proper accountability is achieved for information system-related property.
          Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example,
          reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential
          limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for
          some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment,
          illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors. Exit interviews are important
          for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination
          actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations,
          organizations consider disabling the information system accounts of individuals
          that are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

          individuals if organizational information and information systems are comprised
          through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations

          with the involvement of chief information officers, senior information security
          officers, information system owners, mission/business owners, and information
          owners/stewards. Organizations also consider the potential adverse impacts
          to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001
          and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level
          adverse impacts. Security categorization processes carried out by organizations
          facilitate the development of inventories of information assets, and along

        prose:
        - <p>Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective
          risk assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities,
          likelihood, and impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
          other organizations, and the Nation based on the operation and use of information
          systems. Risk assessments also take into account risk from external parties
          (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf
          of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems,
          outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication
          initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information
          systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information.
          As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access to
          federal information systems. Risk assessments (either formal or informal)
          can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e.,
          organization level, mission/business process level, or information system
          level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments
          can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework,
          including categorization, security control selection, security control implementation,
          security control assessment, information system authorization, and security
          control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially
          implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete
          the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can
          play an important role in security control selection processes, particularly
          during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control
          supplementation.</p>

        - '<p>Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency
          and comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the
          required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring
          that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners,
          and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software
          applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis,
          dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches.
          Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools
          (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers)
          and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example:
          (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols,
          and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii)
          scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information
          flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express
          vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming
          convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)
          to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources
          for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
          listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security
          control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of
          potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider
          using tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability
          Scoring System (CVSS).</p>'

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation
          for the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational
          information systems. To apply the required security controls within the
          system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information
          security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical
          missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8
          cannot be properly applied if individuals that design, code, and test information
          systems and system components (including information technology products)
          do not understand security. Therefore, organizations include qualified personnel,
          for example, chief information security officers, security architects, security
          engineers, and information system security officers in system development
          life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated
          into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers
          include individuals on the development team that possess the requisite security
          expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are effectively
          integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training
          programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and
          responsibilities have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise
          to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The effective
          integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps
          to ensure that important security considerations are addressed early in
          the system development life cycle and that those considerations are directly
          related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also
          facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into
          the enterprise architecture, consistent with organizational risk management
          and information security strategies.</p>

        - '<p>Information system components are discrete, identifiable information
          technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent
          the building blocks of an information system. Information system components
          include commercial information technology products. Security functional
          requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security
          mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities,
          functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance
          to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance
          requirements include: (i) development processes, procedures, practices,
          and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and assessment activities
          providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality
          has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved.
          Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development
          life cycle. Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements
          are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that
          have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring
          process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through
          the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of
          platform dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation
          provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and
          operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security
          documentation is based on the security category or classification level
          of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on
          the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall
          risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management
          strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally mandated
          configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and
          services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system
          components, and information system services are defined in the same manner
          as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The
          Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information
          security requirements from FISMA.</p>'

          - <p>The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early
            in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements
            definition and design phases) allows organizations to influence the design
            of the information system, information system component, or information
            system service. This early involvement in the life cycle helps organizations
            to avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services
            that pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved
            in blocking specific ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring
            information system service providers to do so). Early identification of
            functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting of
            security controls after the information system, system component, or information
            system service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external
            information system services with organizations identifying which functions,
            ports, protocols, and services are provided from external sources.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation
          and operation of security controls associated with information systems,
          system components, and information system services. Organizations consider
          establishing specific measures to determine the quality/completeness of
          the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur,
          for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack
          of support from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations
          may need to recreate selected documentation if such documentation is essential
          to the effective implementation or operation of security controls. The level
          of protection provided for selected information system, component, or service
          documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification
          of the system. For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons
          system or command and control system would typically require a higher level
          of protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses
          information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of
          protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example,
          initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after
          any lapse in system operation.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>External information system services are services that are implemented
          outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems.
          This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational
          information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using
          external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting
          federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal
          government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements
          that federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships
          with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example,
          through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements,
          lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain exchanges.
          The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information
          system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external
          to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish
          and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the
          potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection
          for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust
          varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external
          providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the
          relationships can be monitored over time. External information system services
          documentation includes government, service providers, end user security
          roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level
          agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe
          measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for
          identified instances of noncompliance.</p>

        parts:

          prose:
          - <p class="description">The organization establishes, documents, and maintains
            trust relationships with external service providers based on <insert param-id="sa-9_e"/>.</p>
        - class: guidance
          prose:
          - <p>The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services
            is at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place
            in the external providers, individually or in combination. Trust relationships
            can help organization to gain increased levels of confidence that participating
            service providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered.
            Such relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential entities
            participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships
            and levels of trust, and the types of interactions between the parties.
            In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the amount of direct control
            organizations are able to exert on external service providers with regard
            to employment of security controls necessary for the protection of the
            service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness
            of those controls. The level of control is typically established by the
            terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level agreements and
            can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating contracts or agreements
            that specify security requirements for the providers) to very limited
            control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity
            services such as commercial telecommunications services). In other cases,
            levels of trust are based on factors that convince organizations that
            required security controls have been employed and that determinations
            of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external
            information system services provided to organizations through well-established
            business relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within
            the tolerable risk range of the organizations using the services. External
            service providers may also outsource selected services to other external
            entities, making the trust relationship more difficult and complicated
            to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may
            find it very difficult to place significant trust in external providers.
            This is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the part of providers,
            but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.</p>

          systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality
          and completeness of the configuration management activities conducted by
          developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards. Safeguards

          of the system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity

          system service requires configuration control throughout the system development
          life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.
          Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if existence/use
          is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional,
          high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation
          documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the running version
          of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant
          hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with previous versions;
          and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs
          of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place,

        - <p>Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases
          of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that
          the required security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
          enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting established security
          requirements. Security properties of information systems may be affected
          by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components.
          These interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications
          and operating systems) may adversely affect previously implemented security
          controls. This control provides additional types of security testing/evaluation
          that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing
          custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis,
          dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches.
          Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g.,
          web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers)
          and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific
          activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses,
          testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the
          degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during
          those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the
          rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g.,
          black box, gray box, or white box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation
          refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in
          the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security
          assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the
          plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and
          protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate
          with the security category or classification level of the information system.
          Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.</p>

            when used early in the development process, when each code change can
            be automatically scanned for potential weaknesses. Static analysis can
            provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to enable developers
            to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis
            can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect
            types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security
            professionals, and evidence that defects were fixed. An excessively high
            density of ignored findings (commonly referred to as ignored or false
            positives) indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or

          (i.e., during design, development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution,
          system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement). Protection
          of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness,
          by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each
          phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing
          strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized
          process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems
          and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats,
          risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement
          processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security
          safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at
          each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and
          information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components.
          This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards
          include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development
          facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting
          development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during
          shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans,
          evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category
          or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify
          documentation protection requirements.</p>'

            Without reasonable visibility and traceability into supply chains (i.e.,
            elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for organizations
            to understand and therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood
            of adverse events. Uniquely identifying acquirer and integrator roles,
            organizations, personnel, mission and element processes, testing and evaluation
            procedures, delivery mechanisms, support mechanisms, communications/delivery
            paths, and disposal/final disposition activities as well as the components
            and tools used, establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment
            of supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial numbers)
            and tagging (using radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual
            supply chain elements including software packages, modules, and hardware
            devices, and processes associated with those elements can be used for
            this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the provenance
            in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event.</p>

        - '<p>This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions
          when designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are
          needed to conduct critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness
          is a characteristic/property of an information system that expresses the
          degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or
          transmits.  Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable
          of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental
          disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur
          in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important
          to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of
          information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security
          features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its
          environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds
          for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application).
          Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information
          systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example,
          by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous
          hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security
          engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a
          set of assurance-related security controls in Appendix E). Assurance is
          also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development
          life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact
          systems and the associated assurance requirements for such systems. The
          additional assurance controls in Table E-4 in Appendix E (designated as
          optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance solutions
          for specific information systems and system components using the concept
          of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays
          that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption
          (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide), limiting the development of
          such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations can
          conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information
          systems, system components, or information system services that require
          high-assurance solutions. Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays
          can be described in the security plans for organizational information systems.</p>'

        - <p>Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and
          informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as
          attack surface reduction, use of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition
          strategies. Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end functional
          decomposition of an information system to identify mission-critical functions
          and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification
          of core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into
          the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the
          hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions,
          including when the functions are shared by many components within and beyond
          the information system boundary. Information system components that allow
          for unmediated access to critical components or functions are considered
          critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality
          is assessed in terms of the impact of the function or component failure
          on the ability of the component to complete the organizational missions
          supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed
          whenever an architecture or design is being developed or modified, including
          upgrades.</p>

          - <p>Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with developer threat and
            vulnerability analyses and information system architecture and design.
            Attack surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations
            by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies
            (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within information systems, information
            system components, and information system services. Attack surface reduction
            includes, for example, applying the principle of least privilege, employing
            layered defenses, applying the principle of least functionality (i.e.,
            restricting ports, protocols, functions, and services), deprecating unsafe
            functions, and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that
            are vulnerable to cyber attacks.</p>

          - <p>Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through
            modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation
            of the model, and that any additional code or implementation details present
            have no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal methods
            can be used to show that the high-level security properties are satisfied
            by the formal information system description, and that the formal system
            description is correctly implemented by a description of some lower level,
            for example a hardware description. Consistency between the formal top-level
            specification and the formal policy models is generally not amenable to
            being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal methods
            may be needed to show such consistency. Consistency between the formal
            top-level specification and the implementation may require the use of
            an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability of formal
            methods to prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation.
            Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant
            hardware, software, and firmware include, for example, mapping registers
            and direct memory input/output.</p>

            modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation
            of the model, and that any additional code or implementation details present
            has no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Consistency
            between the descriptive top-level specification (i.e., high-level/low-level
            design) and the formal policy model is generally not amenable to being
            fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal methods may
            be needed to show such consistency. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms
            strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware
            include, for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output.</p>

          mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation or custom development of
          such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance. This
          is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware,
          software, and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are
          less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative sourcing is available
          and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom develop critical
          information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g.,
          enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access,
          and protection from deletion of system and application files.</p>

          in the SC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - <p>Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions
          necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or
          servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation of
          user functionality from information system management functionality is either
          physical or logical. Organizations implement separation of system management-related
          functionality from user functionality by using different computers, different
          central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different
          network addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or
          other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes, for example,
          web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for
          users of any other information system resources. Separation of system and
          user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different
          domains and with additional access controls.</p>

      - class: guidance
        prose:
        - <p>The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions
          by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains).
          Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware,
          software, and firmware that perform those security functions. Information
          systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions
          from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including, for example,
          through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor
          modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved
          through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk,
          and address space protections that protect executing code. Information systems
          restrict access to security functions through the use of access control
          mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal
          is for all of the code within the security function isolation boundary to
          only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include
          nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception.</p>

            actions to minimize the nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security
            function boundary. Nonsecurity functions contained within the isolation
            boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or maliciousness
            in such software, by virtue of being within the boundary, can impact the
            security functions of organizational information systems. The design objective
            is that the specific portions of information systems providing information
            security are of minimal size/complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity
            functions in the security-relevant components of information systems allows
            designers and implementers to focus only on those functions which are
            necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access
            enforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation
            boundaries, the amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security
            policies is reduced, thus contributing to understandability.</p>

          guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems,
          or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security architecture (e.g., routers
          protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks).
          Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks
          are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting
          interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example,
          restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed
          interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing
          internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial
          telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated
          with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are
          commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems
          shared by all attached commercial customers, and may also include third
          party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission
          services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security
          provisions.</p>

          - <p>This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g.,
            notebook computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling
            in those devices, and by preventing those configuration settings from
            being readily configurable by users. This control enhancement is implemented
            within the information system by the detection of split tunneling (or
            of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device,
            and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split
            tunneling. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate
            with local information system resources such as printers/file servers.
            However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external connections,
            making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational
            information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned
            with appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with
            sufficient assurance that it can effectively treat such connections as
            non-remote connections from the confidentiality and integrity perspective.
            VPNs thus provide a means for allowing non-remote communications paths
            from remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not
            eliminate the need for preventing split tunneling.</p>

            (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or services) from other organizational

            the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional
            protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices
            are one of the most common proxy servers providing access to the Internet.
            Proxy servers support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol
            (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
            domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies can be

          - <p>Organizations can isolate information system components performing

            system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability

            control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced
            protection limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The
            degree of separation provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen.
            Boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, routers, gateways,
            and firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks
            or subnetworks, cross-domain devices separating subnetworks, virtualization
            techniques, and encrypting information flows among system components using

        - <p>This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types
          of information system components from which information can be transmitted
          (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners,
          facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection
          of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception
          and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational
          information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by employing protected
          distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing encryption techniques).
          Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services
          as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services
          which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs), may find
          it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation
          of needed security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity.
          In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality/integrity
          services are available in standard, commercial telecommunication service
          packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary security
          controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting
          vehicles, organizations implement appropriate compensating security controls
          or explicitly accept the additional risk.</p>

          modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations
          employ trusted paths for high-assurance connections between security functions
          of information systems and users (e.g., during system logons). Enforcement
          of trusted communications paths is typically provided via an implementation
          that meets the reference monitor concept.</p>

          Information, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of
          information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances
          for such information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography
          can also be used to support random number generation and hash generation.
          Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography
          and NSA-approved cryptography. This control does not impose any requirements
          on organizations to use cryptography. However, if cryptography is required
          based on the selection of other security controls, organizations define
          each type of cryptographic use and the type of cryptography required (e.g.,
          protection of classified information: NSA-approved cryptography; provision
          of digital signatures: FIPS-validated cryptography).</p>'

          to property. Preserving information system state information facilitates

          requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets
          for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering
          routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms
          to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use
          of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection
          can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)
          technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including,
          for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate
          protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous
          monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.</p>

          targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available
          attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber attacks. For example, virtualization
          techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise information
          systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without
          the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection
          techniques including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization,
          may sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase
          the risk of discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection
          techniques may also provide organizations additional time to successfully
          perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort
          required to support concealment/misdirection techniques, it is anticipated
          that such techniques would be used by organizations on a very limited basis.</p>

            and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature of organizational
            information systems targeted by adversaries, make such systems more susceptible
            to cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful.
            Changing organizational processing and storage locations (sometimes referred
            to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat
            (APT) using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing,

            resources (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions
            and business functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or
            storage sites introduces uncertainty into the targeting activities by
            adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries
            making compromises or breaches to organizational information systems much

        - '<p>Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential
          adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions
          of organizations by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified
          information that specifically relates to the planning and execution of sensitive
          organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves five steps: (i) identification
          of critical information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii)
          analysis of threats; (iii) analysis of vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment
          of risks; and (v) the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC
          safeguards are applied to both organizational information systems and the
          environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect
          the confidentiality of key information including, for example, limiting
          the sharing of information with suppliers and potential suppliers of information
          system components, information technology products and services, and with
          other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information critical
          to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element
          uses, suppliers, supply chain processes, functional and security requirements,

        - <p>This control applies to internal and external wireless communication
          links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized information
          system users. Adversaries can exploit the signal parameters of wireless
          links if such links are not adequately protected. There are many ways to
          exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny
          service, or to spoof users of organizational information systems. This control
          reduces the impact of attacks that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations
          rely on commercial service providers for transmission services as commodity
          items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to
          implement this control.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make

          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations

          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the

        - <p>Organizations identify information systems affected by announced software
          flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and
          report this information to designated organizational personnel with information
          security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates include, for
          example, patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations
          also address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring,
          incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take
          advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration
          (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating
          flaws discovered in organizational information systems. By incorporating
          flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management processes, required/anticipated
          remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation actions
          that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether
          organizations follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability
          Alerts. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant
          software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including,
          for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality
          of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered
          flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other
          types. Organizations determine the degree and type of testing needed for
          the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and also
          the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations,
          organizations may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware
          updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when implementing simple
          anti-virus signature updates. Organizations may also consider in testing
          decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained
          from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures.</p>

        - <p>Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
          electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers,
          workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes,
          for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code
          can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained
          within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography.
          Malicious code can be transported by different means including, for example,
          web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable
          storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation
          of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms
          include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based
          technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate
          the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive
          software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of
          unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious
          code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for
          example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that
          could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious
          code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations,
          organizations rely instead on other safeguards including, for example, secure
          coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
          processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not
          perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine
          that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may
          be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response
          to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to
          detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection
          of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.</p>

          information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary
          protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring
          within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems,
          for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing
          other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access,
          and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of
          the events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through
          a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion
          prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools,
          audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic
          locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter
          locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such
          devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with
          controls SC-7 and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department
          of Homeland Security can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity
          of monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring
          objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives.
          Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text
          Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information
          system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring
          and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as
          input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network
          connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network
          (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection
          with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet).
          Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.</p>

            on objects or information systems that have been compromised. IOCs for
            the discovery of compromised hosts can include for example, the creation
            of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include, for example,
            Universal Resource Locator (URL) or protocol elements that indicate malware
            command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs
            can improve information security by reducing the time that information

          the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). Information includes metadata such
          as security attributes associated with information. State-of-the-practice
          integrity-checking mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy
          checks, cryptographic hashes) and associated tools can automatically monitor
          the integrity of information systems and hosted applications.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs
          (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies
          that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software
          applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured
          messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules
          or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured
          data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications
          use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly
          encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands
          or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control
          information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives
          the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret
          the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters
          prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.
          Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent
          attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by
          significantly reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window
          of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber
          attacks. By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected information
          system components, organizations can provide a known state computing resource
          for a specific period of time that does not give adversaries sufficient
          time on target to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational information
          systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Since the advanced
          persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard to capability, intent,
          and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period of time,
          a percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information
          system components and services are activated as required using protected
          information and terminated periodically or upon the end of sessions. Non-persistence
          increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or
          breach organizational information systems. Non-persistent system components
          can be implemented, for example, by periodically re-imaging components or
          by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services
          can be implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines
          or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent
          or non-persistent).The benefit of periodic refreshes of information system
          components/services is that it does not require organizations to first determine
          whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that
          may often be difficult for organizations to determine). The refresh of selected
          information system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency
          to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency
          that it makes the information system unstable. In some instances, refreshes
          of critical components and services may be done periodically in order to
          hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Information security program plans can be represented in single documents
          or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans
          document the program management controls and organization-defined common
          controls. Information security program plans provide sufficient information
          about the program management controls/common controls (including specification
          of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly
          or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant
          with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred
          if the plans are implemented as intended. The security plans for individual
          information systems and the organization-wide information security program
          plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed
          within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to
          the organization�s information security program plan unless the controls
          are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g.,
          security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing
          organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational
          information systems). The organization-wide information security program
          plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of
          common controls. Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls
          in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents,
          the documents describing common controls are included as attachments to
          the information security program plan. If the information security program
          plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document
          the organizational official or officials responsible for the development,
          implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective
          common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities
          Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously
          monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE
          family when such controls are not associated with a particular information
          system but instead, support multiple information systems.</p>

        - <p>The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned
          with the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information
          security requirements and associated security controls into the organization�s
          enterprise architecture helps to ensure that security considerations are
          addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle and
          are directly and explicitly related to the organization�s mission/business
          processes. This process of security requirements integration also embeds
          into the enterprise architecture, an integral information security architecture
          consistent with organizational risk management and information security
          strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed
          at a system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the
          organizational information systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture
          is developed at a level representing an individual information system but
          at the same time, is consistent with the information security architecture
          defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control
          integration are most effectively accomplished through the application of

        - <p>Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities
          to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through
          the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity,
          or availability). Information protection needs are derived from the mission/business
          needs defined by the organization, the mission/business processes selected
          to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy.  Information
          protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization
          and the associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes.
          Inherent in defining an organization�s information protection needs is an
          understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise
          of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to make
          such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions
          and associated information protection requirements are documented by the
          organization in accordance with organizational policy and procedure.</p>

      - class: guidance
        prose:
        - <p>Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive
          Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider
          threat programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat
          programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to
          improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national
          security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to detect
          and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration
          and analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify
          potential insider threat concerns. A senior organizational official is designated
          by the department/agency head as the responsible individual to implement
          and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration
          and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency
          insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user
          monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified
          computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive
          access to information from all offices within the department/agency (e.g.,
          human resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information
          technology, information system security, and law enforcement) for insider
          threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department/agency insider
          threat posture. Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident
          handling teams organizations may already have in place, such as computer
          security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially
          important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some
          types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in
          the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts
          with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform
          and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring
          efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all
          monitoring activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation,
          directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.</p>

          importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats.
          Security groups and associations include, for example, special interest
          groups, forums, professional associations, news groups, and/or peer groups
          of security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select
          groups and associations based on organizational missions/business functions.
          Organizations share threat, vulnerability, and incident information consistent
          with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
          standards, and guidance.</p>

      title: THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM

      - class: statement
        prose:
        - <p class="description">The organization implements a threat awareness program
          that includes a cross-organization information-sharing capability.</p>
      - class: guidance
        prose:
        - <p>Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,
          especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely
          that adversaries may successfully breach or compromise organizational information
          systems. One of the best techniques to address this concern is for organizations
          to share threat information. This can include, for example, sharing threat
          events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have
          experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against
          certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings
          about threats that are likely to occur). Threat information sharing may
          be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial cooperatives, government-government
          cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations taking part in threat-sharing
          consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special
          agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared.</p>
