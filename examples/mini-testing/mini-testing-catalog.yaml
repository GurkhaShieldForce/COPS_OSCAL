        - <p>Privacy impact assessments are an analysis of how information is managed
          to ensure that such management conforms to applicable legal, regulatory,
          and policy requirements regarding privacy; to determine the associated privacy
          risks and effects of creating, collecting, using, processing, storing, maintaining,
          disseminating, disclosing, and disposing of information in identifiable
          form in a system; and to examine and evaluate the protections and alternate
          processes for managing information to mitigate potential privacy concerns.
          A privacy impact assessment is an analysis and a formal document detailing
          the process and outcome of the analysis. To conduct the analysis, organizations
          use risk assessment processes. Although privacy impact assessments may be
          required by law, organizations may develop policies to require privacy impact
          assessments in circumstances where a privacy impact assessment would not
          be required by law.</p>

        prose:
        - <p>Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require
          significant protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example,
          supply chain risk management, and informs the prioritization of protection
          activities. The identification of critical system components and functions
          considers applicable regulations, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines,
          system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and
          system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct an end-to-end
          functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions
          and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification
          of core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into
          the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the
          hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions,
          including when the functions are shared by many components within and beyond
          the system boundary. The operational environment of a system or component
          may impact the criticality including, for example, the connections to and
          dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and
          outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to
          critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the
          inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Component and function
          criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function
          failure on the organizational missions supported by the system containing
          those components and functions. A criticality analysis is performed when
          an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If
          done early in the system life cycle, organizations may consider modifying
          the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and
          functions by, for example, adding redundancy or alternate paths into the
          system design.</p>
