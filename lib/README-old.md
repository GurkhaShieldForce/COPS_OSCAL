# OSCAL Library Files

This directory contains a variety of library files. These are libraries of transformations and utilities currently implemented in XML technologies: CSS, XSLT, XProc. These are all works in progress and under active maintenance and development. As such, they are likely to change. Some of them (such as CSS files) have general purposes; others (such as XSLT or XQuery) may have very narrow uses.

The structure and contents of the directory are as follows:

* [CSS](CSS): This directory contains CSS files to be used in conjunction with OSCAL XML in an editing or browsing application.
* [XProc](XProc): This directory contains W3C XProc implementations of pipelined transformations. Currently, only a resolve-and-render pipeline is given for testing profile resolution.
* [XSLT](XSLT): This directory contains XSLT transformations. There are several subdirectories of stylesheets for various purposes.
* [sketch](sketch): This directory contains experimental XSLT and XProc files used for an XProc pipeline calling XSLT transformations to produce a graphical representation of an XML data structure. The contents of this directory are under development.
* [util](util): This directory contains miscellaneous utility transformations and queries.
