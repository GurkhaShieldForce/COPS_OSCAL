# OSCAL Libraries and Other Supporting Files - sketch

This directory contains XSLT and XProc files used for a specific pipeline in support of documentation. The XSLTs can read an XML file (such as an OSCAL file) and draw a picture of it, producing the picture in SVG. It has been tested for viability, but not demonstrated or used. However, it will be potentially useful once we have integrated unit testing and wish to validate processes.
