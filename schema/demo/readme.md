# Demo metaschema for testing

To do:

- [x] isolate and shake out so all parts run without error, producing results
- [x] go back and test with out of line examples (both XML and JSON sides)
- [ ] include prose module into schema as literal - when exists(//prose)
- [ ] rebuild 'import' as 'model/@echo' 
- [ ] write and test shell XSLT for markdown docs production

Further:

- [ ] embedded Schematron or equivalent / OSCAL declarations model in metaschema?
- [ ] implement namespaces per metaschema
