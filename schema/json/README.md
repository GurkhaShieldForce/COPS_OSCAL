# OSCAL JSON Schema Representation Files and Directories

The structure and content of the directory are as follows:

* [oscal-catalog.json](oscal-catalog.json): This file is a reference copy of the OSCAL schema. Any OSCAL document except profiles will be valid to this schema. This (machine-generated) copy of the maintenance schema has element descriptors (embedded documentation) injected into it for use by tools.
* [oscal-framework.json](oscal-framework.json): This file is a reference copy of the experimental framework schema.
* [oscal-profile.xsd](oscal-profile.xsd): This file is a reference copy of the entry schema for OSCAL **profile** documents.
