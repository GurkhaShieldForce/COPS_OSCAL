# Changes from Milestone 2 to Milestone 3 OSCAL

## `metadata` changes (all models)

Milestone 3 has two assemblies in the metadata, **revision** for tracking a revision history, and **location**, an abstraction (and alternative) to the older address modeling.

\[M2] model: title (field), published? (field), last-modified (field), version (field), oscal-version (field), doc-id* (field), prop* (field), link* (field), role* (assembly), party* (assembly), responsible-party* (assembly), remarks? (field)

\[M3] model: title (field), published? (field), last-modified (field), version (field), oscal-version (field), **revision\* (assembly)**, doc-id* (field), prop* (field), link* (field), role* (assembly), **location\* (assembly)**, party* (assembly), responsible-party* (assembly), remarks? (field)

## `back-matter` changes (all models)

In the back matter, the old `citation` element has been refactored as a special case of `resource`.

\[M2] model: citation* (assembly), resource* (assembly)

\[M3] model: resource* (assembly)

## New `revision` assembly: Revision History Entry (all models)

Tracking revisions can now be done by capturing a snapshot of metadata at an earlier point, potentially with properties or remarks added to indicate revision status or purpose.

\[M3] model: title? (field), published? (field), last-modified? (field), version? (field), oscal-version? (field), prop* (field), link* (field), remarks? (field)

## New `location` assembly: Location (all models)

A new assembly permits factoring out geographic or contact information (an address or contact point) into a separate data structure, for reference using its `uuid` flag.

\[M3] model: title? (field), address (assembly), email* (field), phone* (field), url* (field), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), remarks? (field)

## New `location-uuid`: Location Reference

## `party` changes (all models)

`party` is for **Party (organization or person)**. It has been refactored to reflect the (somewhat arbitrary) 'organization' vs 'person' distinction into a `type` flag.

Where before, we had an `id` flag, now we have `uuid`. We also have `type`, a flag whose value can capture "person" or "organization".

We also have new fields for linking to other assemblies, including `member-of-organization`. Instead of `org-name` and `person-name` we simply have `party-name`.

\[M2] flags: id? (flag)

\[M3] flags: uuid? (flag), type? (flag)

\[M2] model: *person\* (assembly)*, *org? (assembly)*, prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), remarks? (field)

\[M3] model: **party-name (field)**, short-name? (field), **external-id\* (field)**, prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), **address\* (assembly), email\* (field), phone\* (field)**, **member-of-organization* (field), location-uuid* (field)**, remarks? (field)

## New field `party-uuid`: Party Reference

This replaces the old `party-id`.

## New field `external-id`: Personal Identifier

This attaches to the new `member-of-organization` field.
 
## New field `member-of-organization`: Organizational Affiliation

## New field `party-name`: Party Name

Replaces `org-name` and `person-name` from the M2 model.

## Refactored `resource`: Resource

The old `citation` assembly is now a child, not a sibling of resource within `back-matter`. As such it has been remodeled to support as much specialized citation information as may be available for a resource.

\[M2] flag: id? (flag)

\[M3] flags: uuid? (flag)

\[M2] model: desc? (field), prop* (field), (A choice: rlink* (assembly), base64? (field) ) , remarks? (field)

\[M3] model: **title? (field)**, desc? (field), prop* (field), **doc-id\* (field)**, **citation? (assembly)**, rlink* (assembly), base64* (field), remarks? (field), **(any)**

New assemblies and fields to support the citation model.

## New field `text`: Biblographic Text

A plain-text capture of a bibliographic citation.

## New assembly `biblio`: Bibliographic Definition

A structured representation of a bibliographic resource (an extension point).

## `citation` changes

A `citation` now appears only as a child of a `resource`.

\[M2] flag: id? (flag)

\[M3] flag: \[none]

\[M2] model:  *target*\* (field), *title*? (field), *desc*? (field), *doc-id*\* (field), prop\* (field), ? (any)

\[M3] model: **text (field)**, prop* (field), biblio? (assembly)

## `system-implementation` changes

An assembly for `leveraged-authorization` has been added. `leveraged-authorization` used to be in `system-characteristics`.

\[M2] model: prop\* (field), annotation\* (assembly), link\* (field), user* (assembly), component\* (assembly), *service*\* (assembly), *interconnection*\* (assembly), system-inventory? (assembly), remarks? (field)

\[M3] model: prop\* (field), annotation\* (assembly), link\* (field), **leveraged-authorization**\* (assembly), user* (assembly), component\* (assembly), system-inventory? (assembly), remarks? (field)


##  `component` changes

The component assembly has been remodeled to permit greater generality and expressiveness. New assemblies include `title`, `purpose`, and `protocol`.

\[M2] flags: : *id*? (flag), name? (flag), component-type? (flag)

\[M3] flags: **uuid**? (flag), component-type? (flag)

\[M2] model: description (field), prop\* (field), annotation\* (assembly), link\* (field), status (assembly), responsible-role\* (assembly), remarks? (field)

\[M3] model: **title** (field), description (field), **purpose**? (field), prop\* (field), annotation\* (assembly), link\* (field), status (assembly), responsible-role\* (assembly), **protocol**\* (assembly), remarks? (field)

## Rename `set-param` to `set-parameter`

In profile SSP models, the assembly used to set a parameter is consistently called `set-parameter`.

## Change to `add`: Addition (profile model)

A new `id-ref` flag permits targeting an addition to a particular object (branch) within the structure addressed for addition. Additionally, an `annotation` element may also be added.

\[M2] flag: position? (flag)

\[M3] flags: position? (flag), **id-ref**? (flag)

\[M2] model: title? (field), param\* (assembly), prop\* (field), link\* (field), part\* (assembly)

\[M3] model: title? (field), param\* (assembly), prop\* (field), **annotation**\* (assembly), link\* (field), part\* (assembly)

## Changing `name` flag to `title` field

On several assemblies, what had been represented with a `name` flag is now represented with a `title` field, which permits inline markup.

`title` now appears in these assemblies: `metadata`, `revision`, `location`, `resource`, `role`, `information-type`, `leveraged-authorization`, `user`, `authorized-privilege`, `component`, and `protocol`.

## Changes of ID to UUID

A number of assemblies that used to carry `id` flags now carry `uuid` flags instead. These include (in the SSP model) : `location`, `party`, `resource`, `diagram`, `user`, `component`, `protocol`, `inventory-item`, `implemented-requirement`, `statement`, and `by-component`. In all models, it includes `location`, `party`, and `resource`. Finally, the full assemblies `catalog`, `profile` and `system-security-plan` fall into this category.

Similarly, flags and fields that are named to indicate they provide a point of reference, are now renamed `-uuid` reflecting when their references is given specifically as a `uuid` (and validated as such) not as an `id`. These include `location-uuid` and `party-uuid`.
