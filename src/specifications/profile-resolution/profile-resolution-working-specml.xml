<SPECIFICATION xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/specml">
  <head>Profile Resolution</head>
  <p>These PRELIMINARY specifications describe how to render an OSCAL profile document in
    the form of an OSCAL catalog. We call this <term>profile resolution</term>.</p>
  <p>These specifications take the form of a tag set mapping between two XML applications, namely
    the OSCAL <term>profile</term> and OSCAL <term>catalog</term> document models. The same mapping
    (transformation from source to target) can be effected using other expressions of the OSCAL
    model such as JSON or YAML object serializations. In these specifications, there will be
    reference to XML constructs such as <q>element</q> and <q>attribute</q> and examples using XML
    syntax: these however are for illustrative purposes only and normative only with respect to the
    semantic mapping, not the syntax as such. The XML orientation of the specification of this
    mapping is an expediency; in the longer term we plan specifications that are
    format-agnostic.</p>
  <section><head>Reading these specifications</head>
  <section>
    <head>Terminology</head>
    <p>In these specifications there are references to <s>source</s>, <t>target</t> and
        <term>result</term>. <s>Source</s> refers sometimes to profile documents as a type
      (abstractly), and sometimes to instance profiles in operation, or elements within profiles
      (particular kinds of sources). <t>Target</t> refers to the intended output of the
      transformation, that is the catalog model generally (as a document type) or, for particular
      source instances or elements, particular targets.</p>
    <p>The term <term>result</term> refers to the actual results of transformation, as opposed to
      the intended or expected results. Conformance to these specifications requires that a
      processor's actual result corresponds to this (nominal) target.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the term <term>directive</term> is used in these specifications to refer to an
      element or combination of elements in source data, which is designed to effect a particular
      outcome in the result catalog. For the most part, directives are in the source profile
      document – for example, a <s>merge/as-is</s> element represents a directive to merge the
      catalog into a structure isomorphic to the source catalog(s), hence <q>as is</q>. Similarly, a
        <s>set</s> element in a profile is a directive to set a parameter value in the result
      catalog.</p>
    <p>In contrast, catalogs do not contain directives but instead, representations of security
      controls and their parts, optionally in groups, on which directives are assumed to operate.
      There is one exception: the <s>insert</s> element in control catalogs is a directive that a
      parameter value be inserted into a particular location in running text (data content), when a
      catalog is rendered.</p>

  <section>
    <head>Use of XPath</head>
    <p>Additionally, in these specifications XPath notation is used to identify elements and
      attributes in the XML. A summary of some lightweight XPath syntax:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><xpath>element</xpath> (unpunctuated) indicates an element named
          <xpath>element</xpath></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><xpath>@attribute</xpath> (punctuated <q>@</q>) indicates an attribute named <xpath>attribute</xpath></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><xpath>elem/@attr</xpath> indicates an attribute named <xpath>attr</xpath> on an element named
            <xpath>elem</xpath></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><xpath>elmn[@att='val']</xpath> indicates an element <xpath>elmn</xpath> that has an
          attribute <xpath>@att</xpath> with value <code>val</code>. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <head>Operational context</head>
    <section>
      <head>Processing context and scope</head>
      <p>A <term>profile</term> in OSCAL represents a selection and configuration of a set of
          <term>controls</term>. In the normal case, the set of controls available to a profile is
        provided by a catalog. For example, the three NIST SP 800-53 profiles representing the
        impact baselines HIGH, MODERATE and LOW: each of these calls on the full SP 800-53/53A
        catalog for its controls. In a data processing system, this dependency can be modeled in the
        form of separate documents - the (nominal) <q>catalog</q> and its <q>profile</q>, the latter
        being the selection and application of controls, as distinct from the catalog from which those controls are derived.</p>
      <p>However, profiles may also select controls from profiles, implicitly selecting from
        underlying catalogs <em>as modified by those profiles</em>. And they can select a combination of 
        controls from more than one catalog or profile origin.</p>
      <p>In the most common case, a profile will source its controls from a single catalog or
        perhaps a complementary pair of catalogs (perhaps an authoritative or standard catalog, plus
        a supplement). In the general case and more broadly, however, OSCAL must support sourcing
        more than one catalog at once, in order to aggregate and organize controls from any sources.
        This specification describes handling that within an ordinary workflow context must be
        considered (and detected and handled) as error conditions, and this especially applies to
        situations where multiple catalogs are sourced, or where the same catalog is sourced more
        than once.</p>
      <p>In order to support these semantics – because whatever data set is sourced by a profile, it
        must <q>look like a catalog</q> – the results of resolving a single profile must be in the
        form of a single (<q>virtual</q> or implicit) catalog. Two different OSCAL processors that
        promise profile resolution, must deliver the same catalog with regard to its controls and
        the structure (groups) in which they are embedded. This specification is designed to make
        this possible, by defining <q>the same</q> in this context.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>Why resolve a profile as a catalog</head>
      <p>A profile is a representation of a delta, a <q>here to there</q>. As such, a profile might
        be conceived of as a recipe or instruction set – a sequence of steps or procedures – whereby
        to create an OSCAL catalog (set of controls describing security requirements) from an OSCAL
        catalog (set of controls describing security requirements). The primary use case for this is
        when we need to make a new catalog to apply to a set of systems, from a canonical, received,
        mandated or standard catalog with a more general scope.</p>
      <p>This is because although catalogs - for example, the controls described in NIST SP 800-53 -
        are published, available for use, and even standardized, they can never be used exactly in
        the form in which they are acquired. They must be taken from the packaging and placed into
        operational context before they mean anything. This typically requires a few operations over
          <q>raw catalogs</q> be supported. We must be able to select controls; we must be able to
        arrange them in order (or not); and we must be able to condition them by setting parameters
        defined for them and making adjustments to them. </p>
      <p>By representing the steps by which a base catalog can be sliced, sifted, amended and
        edited, into a (nominally) finished or ready set of control requirements, a profile makes it
        easier to codify and preserve even very temporary local revisions of a control catalog. Once
        expressed as a profile in OSCAL syntax, that is, a set of emendations to a catalog can be
        managed entirely separately and independently from the catalog.</p>
      <p>This separation of concerns - between the originating catalog authors, who describe policy
        in only general terms, and the authors of the <q>user manual</q> catalog, who must describe
        policy in very particular and local terms - is a necessary factor in supporting sustainable
        processes with the potential for automation and process improvement. An OSCAL profile
        bridges the gap between a set of general guidelines, and actionable rules. Only by examining
        the system in the context of the <q>actual intentions</q> appropriate to that system, can we
        properly assess its security. </p>
      <p>In order for this to work however we need a process that can perform the necessary
        operations, to apply the delta to an unmodified catalog, to produce the local view of the
        catalog as modified. This is profile resolution.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>Formal validation of source and result</head>
      <p>In an XML context, document validation is available as a means of determining whether an
        arbitrary XML document entity conforms to structural and naming constraints such as must be
        assumed by processors respecting application semantics. These specifications assume that XML
        inputs for profile resolution will be <em>schema-valid</em> with respect to the OSCAL
          <term>profile</term> model, and hence will be tagged in the namespace
          <code>http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0</code>.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the definition of the output format or results, is constrained by the OSCAL
          <term>catalog</term> model as defined by its schema.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>ID uniqueness constraint</head>
      <p>In addition to the respective schemas, there are additional constraints over the data that
        this process relies on, both implicit (and unspecified) constraints regarding usage (to
        whatever extent this specification fails to define clear boundaries and expected behaviors),
        and explicit constraints not validated by the applicable schema. The most important of these
        is ID-distinctiveness. Every <s>id</s> flag (in XML, represented by <xpath>@id</xpath>
        attributes) on an element in the model, whether it be attached to a control, group or an
        element within a control, must be distinct and unique, within the defined processing scope,
        inasmuch as this value will be used in processing as a proxy for <term>element
          identity</term> and especially (in the case of controls) for <term>control
        identity</term>. That is, it is on the basis of their IDs that controls are selected and
        referenced, and clashes are detected and recognized between competing representations of
        controls.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons a document may be considered by this specification as
          <term>invalid</term>, is that violates constraints over ID uniqueness, even if it is
        formally schema-valid. Because in current versions, the OSCAL schemas do not formally
        validate the distinctiveness of ID values, this constraint – within the scope of either the
        source document (at minimum) or across a larger operational environment as appropriate –
        must be checked by another process. For SP800-53 control catalog we have a Schematron for
        this purpose of validating that IDs given to all elements, including those representing
        controls, parts of controls such as statements or assessment objectives, parameters etc.,
        are all unique within the catalog.</p>
      <p>Because ID distinctiveness within the scope of processing, is critical, OSCAL users should
        take care that different catalogs have distinct sets of IDs. This applies to all structures
        within the catalogs, not only controls but also groups, parameters, citations and
        resources.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>Detecting issues in profiles</head>
      <p>It is frequently possible by static analysis to detect many conditions even in valid
        profile documents, that will result in problematic catalogs in resolution. The most common
        issue will be clashing controls, that is more than one control with a given identifier (ID),
        making references to such controls ambiguous. Such analysis is outside the scope of these
        specifications.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>Comments in result documents</head>
      <p>In an XML-based profile resolution, XML comments are one easy way for a processor to trace
        events or conditions without affecting the output's nominal semantics. To support this,
        while two processors are obliged to return the same catalog XML for the same profile XML
        inputs, they are not required to match one another's comments, whitespace usage, attribute
        order, or processing instructions, only each other's elements and attributes.</p>
      <p>One consequence of this is that processes intended to compare two profile resolutions may
        have to accommodate differences in comments, considering them as insignificant along with
        other differences in serialization.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <head>Result catalog structure</head>
    <section>
      <head>Form and organization of resolution result</head>
      <p>The output of a profile resolution should take the form of a catalog.</p>
      <p>In most cases, catalog results will be valid to the OSCAL catalog. <revisit>Where invalid
          results are possible, this specification should note the possibility and the expected
          variance.</revisit></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>Validation of resolution result</head>
      <p>Although the result of profile resolution takes the form of a catalog, it may not be valid
        to all constraints that define the OSCAL catalog format, whether enforced by its schema or
        by other means such as Schematron. This is because correct processing of incoherent inputs
        (even when valid to the profile schema) must result in incoherent outputs.</p>
      <p>The conditions that produce invalid outputs can however be detected and prevented. [Any
        other issues here?]</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If the merge behavior is set to <s>combine[@method='keep']</s>, or not given (as this
            setting is the default), a profile with multiple calls on controls will result in
            mulitiple copies of controls with clashing IDs. These should both raise validation
            errors since IDs must be unique on elements in document scope.</p>
          <p>This can be prevented in either of two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Ensure that no controls are called more than once, even across separate imports.
                This condition can generally be detected statically by comparing the imports, taking
                their catalogs into account when <s>include/all</s> is used (explicitly or
                implicitly when no <s>include</s> is given).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Use another combination method (<s>method='use-first'</s> or <s>method='merge'</s>)
                to resolve the clashes.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p> by using a different combination rule and/or (the correct solution in any case) by
            ensuring that and that any groups called more than once in different imports of a given
            catalog (even indirectly by way of intervening profiles) are merged using
              <s>merge/as-is</s> or <s>merge/custom</s>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Similarly, <s>combine[@method='keep']</s> can result in clashing groups, even
            containing distinct (non-clashing) controls, when a source catalog with group structures
            is called more than once (in parallel imports). Such groups can be merged by using
            either directive <s>merge/as-is</s> or <s>merge/custom</s>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>top-level @id</head>
      <p>Because document IDs are sometimes used to distinguish data points in processing context, a
        resolved profile may not present the same ID as any of the catalogs it is importing, or the
        same ID as its source profile.</p>
      <p>It is permitted to produce the profile’s ID in resolution via a static mapping from the ID
        of the source. For example, the resolution of profile with ID <code>profile-X</code> might
        have ID <code>profile-X-RESOLVED</code>.</p>

        profile]</p>

</tagging>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>Body of the result</head>
      <p>The body of the result <t>catalog</t>, after the metadata, is structured as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If no <s>merge</s> was given, or if <s>merge</s> is given without <s>custom</s> or
              <s>as-is</s>, controls are flat (unstructured) in the result catalog.</p>
          <p>The result catalog has a content model as follows <revisit>(RNC notatation)</revisit>:
              <code>(metadata, param*, control*, back-matter?)</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If <s>merge/as-is</s> is used, the structure of the result will reflect the
            structure(s) of the source catalog(s).</p>
          <p>The result catalog has the content model <code>(metadata, param*, control*, group*,
              back-matter?)</code> where <code>group</code> has the model <code>(title?, control*,
              group*)</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If <s>merge/custom</s> is used, see above. The content model of the result catalog is
            the same as that for <s>merge/as-is</s>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>(Examples)</p>
      <p>Unless it be for special purposes in a debugging or tracing mode, profile results may not
        show and groups or structures in the form of elements not described here. Depending on the
        merge directive, all groups will be given either by the catalog source(s)
          (<s>merge/as-is</s>) or the profile (<s>merge/custom</s>), or there will be no groups at
        all (no merge rule).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <head>Profile and catalog back matter</head>
      <p>Profiles may have back matter, and so may the catalogs (or resolved profiles) they import.
        Elements in the back matter include <s>citation</s> and <s>resource</s>.</p>
      <p>Either of these elements may be cross-referenced elsewhere in profile source by means of a
        URI fragment identifier on an <s>href</s> flag, for example <code>&lt;resource
          id="document-X</code>> may be referenced by <code>&lt;link href="#document-X"></code>.</p>
      <p>Elements in the profile back matter must persist in the result if either of two conditions
        obtains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The element is referenced from the profile metadata</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The element is referenced from a link or anchor (<s>link</s> or <s>a</s> element)
            inside controls, parameters, or any copy (for example, <t>group/part</t> included in the
            resolved profile).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In resolution, one way of obtaining this result is to permit all contents of back matter to
        persist until controls are selected and modified (that is, through the modification stage),
        and then filter these to include only those elements still referenced by included
        contents.</p>

      <head>Profile mapping to catalog</head>
      <p>Considered as a <q>document</q> or integrated data set (object), a profile has three sections,
        each of which corresponds to a conceptual step in resolution. To resolve a catalog fully is
        to perform all these steps.</p>
      <p>While the steps are described in this specification as occurring in sequence, a profile
        processor is not obliged to perform them in the order described. Conformance to these
        specifications is determined by whether the results of processing (*resolution*) appear as
        described, not on whether the means to produce those results work in exactly the manner
        described here.</p>
      <p>The three steps are <term>import</term> (control selection); <term>merge</term>; and
        <term>modify</term>. In brief:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><term>import</term> identifies one or more control sources (catalogs or profiles) and the
          controls within them to be included in this profile</p></li>
        <li><p><term>merge</term> produces the rules for how controls will be organized and merged (or not)</p></li>
        <li><p><term>modify</term> indicates how parameters in the underlying catalog may be modified or set,
          and how control contents may be amended or modified.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The selection (import) stage is mandatory inasmuch as a profile that imports no controls is
      inoperative. Such a profile is not in error and it can be resolved, but its resolution will
      contain no controls (and as such might fail a validation check against the catalog
      schema).</p>
      <p>The merge stage can be considered mandatory in that there are default rules for merging, to
        be followed when no merge behavior is given; thus <q>no merging</q> is permitted, and a profile
        with no merge semantics indicated is not in error.</p>
      <p>The modify stage is optional in that controls do not have to be modified and parameters do
      not have to be set; a profile is always free to represent these components as they are given
      in their catalogs. Leaving a parameter unset, or qualifying its setting (with additional
      information or constraints) without modifying its value, is also possible; like a catalog, a
      profile can represent a set of controls (and parameters) that are not fully defined, for
      purposes of use at another layer (profile or implementation) where such definition can be
      provided.</p>
      <p>When resolved, an OSCAL profile takes the form of an OSCAL catalog, whose organization and
        parts are described in the next section. The merge semantics described below will produce
        outputs conforming to this organization.</p>
    <section>
      <head>Catalog results - top level</head>
      <p>The following sections describe how to populate and organize the body of a result catalog
        (a target) with controls invoked by a profile from a source catalog. At its base, an OSCAL
          <s>profile</s> source should produce a <t>catalog</t>:</p>
      <mapping unit-test="base-test_profile.xml">
        <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;profile id="profile-identifier">...&lt;/profile></tagging>
        <tagging whose="target_catalog">&lt;catalog id="{new-catalog-identifier}">
  &lt;metadata>[Required metadata, as described below]&lt;/metadata>
  [ Controls or control groups, as described below ]
  &lt;back-matter>[Optional back matter as described below]&lt;/back-matter>
&lt;/catalog></tagging>
      </mapping>
      <p>A valid catalog must have <t>metadata</t> in addition to controls and control groups.
        Additionally it may have <t>back-matter</t>. How to produce and populate the <t>metadata</t>
        and <t>back-matter</t> is described below, as is the construction of the <t>catalog/@id</t>
        in the result.</p>
      <p>Since <t>metadata</t> and <t>back-matter</t> both have dependencies on the processing of
        the main body, however (in particular where multiple catalogs are sourced), how controls are
        selected and modified is discussed first.</p>
    </section>
      <section>
        <head>Import - select controls</head>
      <p>A profile begins by importing catalogs, all of whose controls are made available. Each
        import constitutes a <term>selection</term> of controls from a catalog or profile. Imports
        are given in series after the metadata:</p>
      <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;profile>
  &lt;metadata>[ Profile metadata ]&lt;/metadata>
  &lt;import href="#catalog">... selection of controls ...&lt;/import>
  &lt;import href="#catalog-supplemental">... selection of controls ...&lt;/import>
&lt;/profile>
</tagging>
        <p>The resource indicated can be either an OSCAL catalog or an OSCAL profile. A catalog
        provides controls in their native form. An imported profile is resolved on import, using the
        same rules for the resolution of the profile at the top level, so a catalog is presented to
        the importing profile.</p>
        <p>No profile may import itself either directly or indirectly. An import directive that
        indicates either the profile itself, or a profile into which it is being (currently)
        imported, must be ignored. Optionally, a processor may issue a warning.</p>
        <p>In an import directive, the reference to the resource to be imported appears on an
          <s>@href</s> flag. It takes either of two forms, external or internal:</p>
        <section>
          <head>External</head>
          <p>An external reference appears as an absolute or relative URL</p>

              <code>resource</code> elsewhere in the profile (typically in back matter), that
            resource can be retrieved to provide the source catalog.</p>

          <head>Circular imports</head>
          <p>When a profile imports a profile, the subordinate profile is resolved into a catalog
            using the same rules. This presents a possibility of circular imports, when a profile is
            directed to import itself either directly or indirectly.</p>
          <p>A <term>circular import</term> is defined as a directive to import a resource, which has already
            been called higher in the import hierarchy. For example, if Profile A imports Profile B,
            and Profile B imports Profile A, the second import is circular. (An import at the top
            can only be circular if a profile tries to import itself.) If A imports B, B imports C
            and C imports A, C’s import is circular.</p>
          <p>Note that an import can only be circular within the context of processing a particular
            profile. In the last example, C’s import would not be circular if invoked in the context
            of resolving B by itself (without being imported by A), or of resolving some other
            profile that did not import A. (D importing B importing C importing A would not be a
            problem.)</p>
          <p>Circular imports are inoperative, and may be reported as an error <revisit>[or
            warning]</revisit>.</p>

          <head>Multiple imports</head>
          <p>Multiple imports of the same resource are not an error as long as no circular
            dependencies occur.</p>
          <p>However, multiple imports may result in invalid outputs. Typically this will be because
          a control has been selected twice, and no merge behavior (see below) has been given.</p>
          <p>In general, sibling imports (two imports into the same profile) should never have to
          call the same catalog; and this condition may be reported as a warning. Depending on the
          merge rules and the particular controls being selected, it may or may not result in
          clashing controls.</p>

        <p>If documents called for import are determined to be unavailable, the processor may drop
          them along with a warning, both or either out of band (e.g. through <code>STDERR</code>)

              <head>Including child controls</head>
              <p>In OSCAL, controls may contain controls. For example, in SP 800-53 many controls
              are supplemented with control enhancements; in OSCAL these are represented as child
              controls within parent controls. So parent AC-2 has children AC-2(1) through AC-2(13),
              for example.</p>
              <p>Child controls can be included by the same mechanism as controls, i.e. by means of
                an ID call. Alternatively a match can frequently be applied (at least given most ID
                assignment schemes) to match controls and child controls together.</p>
              <p>Additionally, a <s>@with-child-controls</s> directive on a <s>call</s> or
                <s>match</s> can indicate that child controls (that is, direct children not all
              descendants) should be included with the applicable call(s) or match(es).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, <s>all[@with-child-controls='no']</s> may select all controls placed
              directly within a group, excluding all  controls appearing inside other controls.</p>

            <p>Additionally, there is no such thing as <s>exclude/all</s>, which is invalid and
            should be considered inoperable.</p>
            <p>Any control designated to be both included and excluded, is excluded. This holds
            irrespective of the specifity of the selection for inclusion or exclusion. For example,
            if AC-1 is included by id <code>ac-1</code> and excluded by matching <code>ac.*</code>,
            it is excluded. Selection for exclusion prevails.</p>

          <p>Parameters may sometimes be given in catalogs outside of controls. For example, a

          <p>These parameters are copied if (only if) a control is also propagated, which after
            modification contains an <s>insert</s> directive referencing this parameter. The
            parameter appears in the location in the resolved catalog corresponding to its location
            in the source, albeit ungrouped if no <s>merge/as-is</s> is given.</p>
          <p>When a catalog is organized by a <s>merge/custom</s> directive, loose parameters are
            copied into the resulting grouping structure directly preceding the first control
            appearing that contains an <s>insert</s> directive referencing that parameter.</p>

        <section>
          <head><s>merge/combine</s> - handling control collisions</head>
          <p><term>Colliding controls</term> (or <term>clashing</term>) describes the condition that
          occurs when multiple invocations of controls with the same ID are given, and so a profile
          resolution will result in duplicative and/or contradictory information. Even given a rule
          against multiple imports of the same resource, it may frequently occur that in profiles
          (especially profiles under development), multiple copies – and with variations – may be
          invoked from different sources. For example, if a profile tailors another profile which
          includes a control with amendments, and then (the top-level profile) includes the same
          control directly from its original catalog, a collision will occur between these two
          variants.</p>
          <p>Generally such a collision is readily detectable as long as IDs have not been modified;
          in other words, constraints over uniqueness (within document scope) of IDs will be
          violated in resolved instances where two (perhaps different) representations of the same
          control appear. Careful profile authors will be able to detect and prevent these resulting
          problems.</p>
        <p>Apart from handling problems and exceptions, however, for different purposes different
          profiles might wish to apply different rules. The combination rules to be applied are
          given in the profile <s>merge/combine</s> element as a <s>method</s> attribute (flag).</p>
          <section>
          <head>No <s>merge/combine</s> given</head>
          <p>If no <s>merge</s> directive is given in the profile, or if a <s>merge</s> is given
            without a <s>combine</s>, control or parameter clashes are treated as if
              <s>merge/combine[@method='keep']</s> were given. A profile with no <s>merge</s>
            directive:</p>
          <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;profile>
  &lt;import href="#catalog1"/>
  &lt;import href="#catalog2"/>
&lt;/profile></tagging>
          <p>is the same as</p>
          <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;profile>
  &lt;import href="#catalog1"/>
  &lt;import href="#catalog2"/>
  &lt;merge>
    &lt;combine method="keep"/>

&lt;/profile></tagging>
        </section>
        <section>
          <head><q>No merge</q> merge rule</head>
          <p>When a merge is indicated by <s>merge combine[@method='keep']</s>, or not given, the
              <q>no merge</q> merge rule is used. Clashing controls or parameters are not merged.
            Their groups are merged only if another <s>merge</s> directive such as <s>as-is</s> is
            given.</p>
          <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;merge>
  &lt;combine method="keep"/>
&lt;/merge>
</tagging>
          <p>Under this directive, colliding controls will result in invalid results, as they will
            both appear in the results with the same ID. Accordingly, this setting may be useful in
            ensuring integrity of references to controls as given in the profile: if any included
            control is called only once, clashing controls will not be produced and validation will
            succeed..</p>

&lt;/merge>
</tagging>
            <p>The first reference to a given control, with respect to the document order of the
            source data, prevails over later references. <q>First</q> is determined by a top-down,
            depth-first traversal of the profile import hierarchy. So if a profile is imported
            before a catalog, and the imported profile presents a representation of a control also
            given in the catalog import, the profile’s representation (perhaps modified) is
            taken.</p>
            <p>The same logic applies to parameter settings.</p>

            <p>The single unified representation is assembled by aggregating all the contents of all

              <head>Implicit inclusions under <s>as-is</s></head>
              <p>Under <term>as is</term>, a resolved profile’s structure is expected to replicate the
                structure of source catalogs.</p>
              <p>This is achieved by propagating, with all controls that are included, all groups
                that they appear within, along with the groups’ IDs, titles and other contents.</p>
              <p>Groups that do not include controls that have been included (either directly or as
                descendants of contained groups, are not propagated to the result.</p>
              <p>In addition to groups, under 'as is' mergine, certain controls will be included
                implicitly. This happens when they have not been called, but they contain controls
                that have been called. Such controls are treated like groups included 'as is' – they
                must be propagated to retain the structure for descendant controls.</p>
              <p>Unlike groups, however, the title of such a control is given with the resolution,
                but no other contents are presented apart from (a) controls included explicitly or
                (b) child controls that must be included for the sake of their own (included) child
                (or descendant) controls.</p>

        <head>Modify - set parameters and amend or alter controls</head>
        <p>(Aka <term>patching</term>) Explicit modification of control content</p>
        <p>There are two ways a control may need to be modified. Commonly, controls might be amended
        – new material might be added. (For example, the priority marker properties P1-P3 in the
        SP800-53 LOW MODERATE and HIGH baselines.) Less commonly, materials might be removed or
        edited.</p>
        <p>OSCAL does not provide for <q>changing</q> a control, but editing can be achieved by removing
          contents and adding (edited) contents back. In other words, editing is considered to be
          the same kind of patching as removing combined with adding.</p>
      <p>In addition to any modification or adjustment to controls, this section of a profile is used
        to set parameter values or other properties of parameters declared in catalogs and
        referenced from their text. Parameters are propagated with the profile's setting into the
        result catalog for its use.</p>
        <section>
          <head>Setting Parameters</head>
          <p>Modification of parameter settings is indicated using <s>set</s>.</p>
          <p>Parameters are not always given within controls. A profile resolution result must
          include copies (with or without modifications or settings) of all parameters defined
          within the source catalog, which are referenced from <s>insert</s> directives anywhere
          inside included controls.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, any parameter referenced by an <s>insert</s> in any source catalog is copied
          from catalog source to result <revisit>parameter propagation rules for merge/as-is,
            merge/custom</revisit> without any configuration required in the profile.</p>
          <p>However, a profile should not reproduce parameters from source catalogs, which are not
          referenced from <s>insert</s> directives.</p>
          <p>When parameters are propagated, they may be modified by <s>set</s> directives given in
          the profile.</p>
        <p>If more than one <s>set</s> directive is given for the same parameter, all are applied,
          in the sequence given in the profile. <revisit>[XXX even when
            merge/combine/@method='use-first'?]</revisit></p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>A <s>set/title</s> replaces the <s>param/title</s> on the affected parameter</p></li>
            <li><p>A <s>set/label</s> replaces the <s>param/label</s> on the affected parameter</p></li>
            <li><p>A <s>set/value</s>
              <em>or</em> a <s>set/select</s> replaces <em>any</em>
              <s>param/value</s> or <s>param/select</s> on the affected parameter</p></li>
            <li><p>Other elements given in a parameter <s>set</s> are added to the affected
              parameter, after elements of the same name</p></li>
            <li><p>The prescribed order of elements in the affected parameter is retained: <t>label</t>;
                <t>usage</t>; <t>constraint</t>; <t>guideline</t>; <t>value</t> or <t>select</t> (a
              choice); and <t>link</t>.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>[example]</p>
          <tagging whose="source_catalog">&lt;param id="p1">
  &lt;title>Password length&lt;/title>
  &lt;value>10&lt;/value>
&lt;/param>
</tagging>
        <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;set param-id="p1">
  &lt;select>
    &lt;choice>10&lt;/choice>
    &lt;choice>11&lt;/choice>
  &lt;/select>
&lt;/set>
</tagging>
        <p>Note that <t>select</t> replaces <s>value</s>:</p>
        <tagging whose="target_catalog">&lt;param id="p1">
  &lt;title>Password length&lt;/title>
  &lt;select>
    &lt;choice>10&lt;/choice>
