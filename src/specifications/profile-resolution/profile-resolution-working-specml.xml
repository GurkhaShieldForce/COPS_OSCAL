<SPECIFICATION xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/specml">
  <head>Profile Resolution</head>
  <p>These specifications describe how to render an OSCAL profile document in
    the form of an OSCAL catalog. We call this <term>profile resolution</term>.</p>
  <p>These DRAFT specifications take the form of a tag set mapping between two XML applications,
    namely the OSCAL <term>profile</term> and OSCAL <term>catalog</term> document models. The same
    mapping (transformation from source to target) can be effected using other expressions of the
    OSCAL model such as JSON or YAML object serializations. In these specifications, there will be
    reference to XML constructs such as <q>element</q> and <q>attribute</q> and examples using XML
    syntax: these however are for illustrative purposes only and normative only with respect to the
    semantic mapping, not the syntax as such. The XML orientation of the specification of this
    mapping is an expediency; in the longer term we plan specifications that are
    format-agnostic.</p>
  <section id="top">
    <head>Reading these specifications</head>
    <section id="terminology">
      <head>Terminology</head>
      <p>In these specifications there are references to <term>source</term>, <term>target</term>
        and <term>result</term>. <term>Source</term> refers sometimes to profile documents as a type
        (abstractly), and sometimes to instance profiles in operation, or elements within profiles
        (particular kinds of sources). <term>Target</term> refers to the intended output of the
        transformation, that is the catalog model generally (as a document type) or, for particular
        source instances or elements, particular targets.</p>
      <p>Elements in the source format are marked in these specifications to appear distinctively as
          <src>source-element</src> (for an element named <q>source-element</q>).</p>
      <p>Elements in the target format are marked in these specifications to appear distinctively as
          <tgt>target-element</tgt> (for an element named <q>target-element</q>).</p>
      <p>The term <term>result</term> refers to the actual results of transformation, as opposed to
        the intended or expected results. Conformance to these specifications requires that a
        processor's result corresponds to the target as described here, given a particular
        source.</p>
      <p>The term <term>directive</term> is used in these specifications to refer to an element or
        combination of elements in source data, which is designed to effect a particular outcome in
        the result catalog. For the most part, directives are in the source profile document – for
        example, a <src>set</src> element in a profile is a directive to set a parameter value in
        the result catalog.</p>
      <p>In contrast to profiles, catalogs do not contain directives but instead, representations of
        security controls and their parts, optionally gathered in groups, on which directives are
        assumed to operate. There is one exception: the <src>insert</src> element in control
        catalogs can be considered a directive that a parameter value be inserted into a particular
        location in running text (data content), when a catalog is rendered. Since these semantics
        respect catalog rendering, however, not profile resolution, they are out of scope for this
        document.</p>
      <p>Finally, this specification describes not only (source) profiles and (result) catalogs, but
          <term>control selections</term> as well. The conceptual model of profile resolution takes
        a profile through several steps, in which controls are collected from source catalogs,
        combined, and potentially modified. As described by this specification, control selections
        are produced during this process, as temporary collections of controls in a transitional
        state. In the last stage of processing, the discrete selections are combined into the single
        result catalog.</p>
      <p>For illustrative purposes, these control selections are, like source and target formats,
        also represented by tagging in examples given here, even though no OSCAL processor is
        obliged to produce or recognize such XML at any point, as long as it produces the same
        results (final outputs) from the same inputs.</p>

      <head>Use of XPath</head>
      <p>Additionally, in these specifications XPath notation is used to identify elements and
        attributes in the XML. A summary of some lightweight XPath syntax:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><xpath>element</xpath> (unpunctuated) indicates an element named
            <xpath>element</xpath></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><xpath>@attribute</xpath> (punctuated <q>@</q>) indicates an attribute named
              <xpath>attribute</xpath></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><xpath>elem/@attr</xpath> indicates an attribute named <xpath>attr</xpath> on an
            element named <xpath>elem</xpath></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><xpath>elmn[@att='val']</xpath> indicates an element <xpath>elmn</xpath> that has an
            attribute <xpath>@att</xpath> with value <code>val</code>. </p>

    <head>Operational context</head>

      <head>Processing context and scope</head>
      <p>A <term>profile</term> in OSCAL represents a selection and configuration of a set of
          <term>controls</term>. In the normal case, the set of controls available to a profile is
        provided by a catalog. For example, the three NIST SP 800-53 profiles representing the
        impact baselines HIGH, MODERATE and LOW: each of these calls on a catalog representing the
        families, controls and control enhancements described in SP 800-53/53A. In a data processing
        system, this dependency can be modeled in the form of separate documents or data instances -
        the (nominal) <q>catalog</q> and its <q>profile</q>, the latter being a selection,
        adaptation and organization of controls, as distinct from the catalog from which those
        controls are derived.</p>
      <p>However, profiles may also select controls from profiles, thus deriving them from
        underlying catalogs as modified by those profiles. This feature enables an organization that
        wishes to promulgate guidelines or requirements to do so by publishing a set of
        customizations to an existing catalog, rather than create a catalog from scratch. Profiles
        can also arrange combinations of controls from more than one catalog or profile origin,
        making it possible to use them to support the creation of hybrid catalogs. </p>
      <p>In the most common case, a profile will acquire its controls from a single catalog or
        perhaps a complementary pair of catalogs (perhaps an authoritative standard catalog, plus a
        supplement). In the general case OSCAL must support sourcing more than one catalog at once,
        in order to aggregate and organize controls from disparate sources. In order to provide
        sensible and transparent results even for incoherent inputs, this specification defines
        these processes such that legible and testable results are produced even when they are
        formally invalid to constraints governing the outputs. Such downstream processing errors
        including validation errors are expected to be detectable and remediable. This especially
        applies to situations where multiple catalogs are sourced, or where the same catalog is
        sourced more than once, directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p>In order to support these semantics – because whatever data set is sourced by a profile, it
        must <q>look like a catalog</q> – the results of resolving a single profile must be in the
        form of a single catalog. Two different OSCAL processors that promise profile resolution,
        must deliver the same catalog with regard to its controls; their ordering (insofar as the
        target format represents ordering); and the structure (groups) in which they are embedded.
        This specification is designed to make this possible, by defining outputs with sufficient
        rigor that <q>the same</q> is meaningful and testable in this context.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="why-a-catalog">
      <head>Why resolve a profile as a catalog</head>
      <p>A profile is a representation of a delta, a <q>here to there</q>. As such, a profile might
        be conceived of as a recipe or instruction set – a sequence of steps or procedures – whereby
        to create an OSCAL catalog (set of controls describing security requirements) from an OSCAL
        catalog (set of controls describing security requirements). The primary use case for this is
        when we need to make a new catalog to apply to a system or set of systems, starting from a
        canonical, received, mandated or standard catalog with a more general scope.</p>
      <p>This is because although catalogs - for example, the controls described in NIST SP 800-53 -
        are published, available for use, and even standardized, they can never be used exactly in
        the form in which they are acquired. They must be taken from the packaging and placed into
        operational context before they mean anything. This typically requires that a few operations
        over <q>raw catalogs</q> be supported by a profiling mechanism. We must be able to select
        controls; we must be able to arrange them in order (or not); and we must be able to qualify
        or condition them by setting parameters defined for them and making adjustments to them. </p>
      <p>By representing the steps by which a base catalog can be sliced, sifted, amended and
        edited, into a (nominally) finished or ready set of control requirements, a profile makes it
        easier to codify and preserve even very incidental or temporary local revisions of a control
        catalog. Once expressed as a profile in OSCAL format, a set of emendations to a catalog can
        be managed entirely separately and independently from the catalog. Because a conformant
        processor can always create the customized catalog by resolving the profile against its
        sources (executing the transformation described in this document), the profile can also be
        examined and used as a proxy for that catalog for other purposes. The customized catalog can
        be made available wherever and for whatever purposes it is needed, while its revision and
        maintenance can be focused on the profile.</p>
      <p>This separation of concerns - between the originating catalog authors, who describe policy
        in only general terms, and the authors of the <q>user manual</q> catalog, who must describe
        policy in very particular and local terms - is a necessary factor in supporting sustainable
        processes with the potential for automation and process improvement. An OSCAL profile
        bridges the gap between a set of general guidelines, and actionable rules. Only by examining
        the system in the context of the actual intentions appropriate to that system, can we
        properly assess its security. Profiles make this possible.</p>
      <p>In order for this to work however we need a process that can perform the necessary
        operations, to apply the delta to an unmodified catalog, to produce the local view of the
        catalog as modified. This is profile resolution.</p>

    <section id="valid-endpoints">
      <head>Formal validation of source and result</head>
      <p>In an XML context, document validation is available as a means of determining whether an
        arbitrary XML document entity conforms to structural and naming constraints such as must be
        assumed by processors respecting application semantics. These specifications assume that XML
        inputs for profile resolution will be <em>schema-valid</em> with respect to the OSCAL
          <term>profile</term> model, and hence will be tagged in the namespace
          <code>http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0</code>.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the definition of the output format or results, is constrained by the OSCAL
          <term>catalog</term> model as defined by its schema.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="id-uniequeness">
      <head>ID uniqueness constraint</head>
      <p>In addition to those described and enforced by the respective schemas, there are additional
        constraints over the data that this process relies on. The most important of these is
        ID-distinctiveness. Every <src>id</src> flag (in XML, represented by <xpath>@id</xpath>
        attributes) on an element in the model, whether it be attached to a control, group or an
        element within a control, must be distinct and unique, within the defined processing scope,
        inasmuch as this value will be used in processing as a proxy for <term>element
          identity</term> and especially (in the case of controls) for <term>control
        identity</term>. That is, it is on the basis of their IDs that controls are selected and
        referenced, and clashes are detected and recognized between competing representations of
        controls.</p>
      <p>A document may be considered by this specification as <term>invalid</term> because it
        violates constraints over ID uniqueness, even if it is formally schema-valid. Because in
        current versions, the OSCAL schemas do not formally validate the distinctiveness of ID
        values, this constraint – within the scope of either the source document (at minimum) or
        across a larger operational environment as appropriate – must be checked by another process.
        For the SP800-53 control catalog, and for profiles derived from it, a Schematron is
        available for this purpose of validating that IDs given to all elements, including those
        representing controls, parts of controls such as statements or assessment objectives,
        parameters etc., are all unique within the catalog.</p>
      <p><revisit>Because ID distinctiveness within the scope of processing, is critical, OSCAL
          users should take care that different catalogs have distinct sets of IDs. This applies to
          all structures within the catalogs, not only controls but also groups, parameters,
          citations and resources.</revisit></p>
    </section>
    <section id="detecting-issues">
      <head>Detecting issues in profiles</head>
      <p>It is frequently possible by static analysis to detect many conditions even in valid
        profile documents, that will result in problematic catalogs in resolution. The most common
        issue will be clashing controls, that is more than one control in underlying catalogs with a
        given identifier (ID), making references to such controls ambiguous. Such analysis is
        outside the scope of these specifications.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="comments-in-result">
      <head>Comments in result documents</head>
      <p>In an XML-based profile resolution, XML comments are one straightforward way for a
        processor to record events or conditions without affecting the output's nominal semantics.
        To support this, while two processors are obliged to return the same catalog XML for the
        same profile XML inputs, they are not required to match one another's comments, whitespace
        usage, attribute order, or processing instructions, only each other's elements, attributes
        and data content.</p>
      <p>One consequence of this is that processes intended to compare two profile resolutions may
        have to accommodate differences in comments, considering them as insignificant along with
        other differences in serialization.</p>

    <section>
      <head>Form and organization of resolution result</head>
      <p>The output of a profile resolution should take the form of a catalog.</p>
      <p>In most cases, catalog results will be valid to the OSCAL catalog schema. <revisit>Where
          invalid results are possible, this specification should note the possibility and the
          expected variance.</revisit></p>
      <p> At its base, an OSCAL <src>profile</src> source produces a <tgt>catalog</tgt>:</p>
      <mapping unit-test="base-test_profile.xml">
        <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;profile id="profile-identifier">...&lt;/profile></tagging>
        <tagging whose="target_catalog">&lt;catalog id="{new-catalog-identifier}">
  &lt;metadata>[Required metadata, as described below]&lt;/metadata>
  [ Controls or control groups, as described below ]
  &lt;back-matter>[Optional back matter as described below]&lt;/back-matter>
&lt;/catalog></tagging>
      </mapping>
      <p>A valid catalog must have <tgt>metadata</tgt> in addition to controls and control groups.
        Additionally it may have <tgt>back-matter</tgt>. How to produce and populate the
          <tgt>metadata</tgt> and <tgt>back-matter</tgt> is described below, as is the construction
        of the <tgt>catalog/@id</tgt> in the result.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="validation-of-result">
      <head>Validation of resolution result</head>
      <p>Although the result of profile resolution takes the form of a catalog, it may not be valid
        to all constraints that define the OSCAL catalog format, whether enforced by its schema or
        by other means such as Schematron. This is because correct processing of incoherent inputs
        (even when valid to the profile schema) must result in incoherent outputs. A range of
        nominally <q>correct</q> results will thus fail in workflows that are properly reliant on
        validation to enforce boundaries around expected input. <xref to="valid-endpoints"/></p>
      <p>The conditions that produce invalid outputs can however be detected and prevented.
          <revisit>[Any other issues here?]</revisit></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If the merge behavior is set to <src>combine[@method='keep']</src>, or not given (as
            this setting is the default), a profile with multiple calls on controls will result in
            multiple copies of controls with clashing IDs. These should both raise validation errors
            since IDs must be unique on elements in document scope.</p>
          <p>This can be prevented in either of two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Ensure that no controls are called more than once, even across separate imports.
                This condition can generally be detected statically by comparing the imports, taking
                their catalogs into account when <src>include/all</src> is used (explicitly or
                implicitly when no <src>include</src> is given).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Use another combination method (<src>method='use-first'</src> or

      <p>Because document IDs are sometimes used to distinguish data points in processing context, a

        same ID as its source profile.</p>
      <p>It is permitted to produce the profile’s ID in resolution via a static mapping from the ID

      <p>The body of the result <tgt>catalog</tgt>, after its <term>metadata</term>, is structured

      <ul>

          <p>The result catalog has a content model as follows <revisit>(DTD/RNC

          (<src>merge/as-is</src>) or the profile (<src>merge/custom</src>), or there will be no
        groups at all (no combination rule).</p>
    </section>
    <section id="back-matter-of-result">
      <head>Back matter</head>
      <p>The back matter in result catalogs is assembled from the back matter of their source
        profiles in combination with the back matter of source catalogs. In both catalogs and
        profiles, <src>back-matter</src> is comprised of (multiple uses of either)
          <src>citation</src> or <src>resource</src>. Either of these elements may be
        cross-referenced from any location in their source documents by means of a URI fragment
        identifier on an <src>href</src> flag, for example <code>&lt;resource id="document-X</code>>
        may be referenced from inside its containing document by <code>&lt;link
          href="#document-X"></code> appearing elsewhere. Whether an element inside back matter must
        be included in the result, depends on whether such a cross-reference has also been included
        in the same result.</p>
      <p>Specifically, any <src>citation</src> or <src>resource</src> inside <src>back-matter</src>
        either in the profile, or in any imported catalog, is considered eligible for propagation
        into the result if either of two conditions obtains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The element is referenced by any element inside the profile metadata.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The element is referenced from a link or anchor (<src>link</src> or <src>a</src>
            element) inside controls, parameters, or any contents (for example, paragraphs inside
              <tgt>group/part</tgt>) included in the resolved profile.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The assembly of the result <tgt>back-matter</tgt> occurs by including copies of all
        eligible <src>citation</src> elements followed by all eligible <src>resource</src> elements,
        in the same order as given in their sources.</p>
      <p>Additionally, combination rules (see next section) will affect whether and how duplicate or
        competing <src>citation</src> or <src>resource</src> elements are handled, to remove or
        combine multiple occurrences of the same referenced object.</p>
      <p>In resolution, one way of obtaining this result is to permit all contents of back matter to
        persist until controls are selected and modified (that is, through the modification stage),
        and then filter these to include only those elements still referenced by included
        contents.</p>

      sections, each of which corresponds to a conceptual step in resolution. To resolve a catalog
      fully is to perform all these steps.</p>
    <p>While the steps are described in this specification as occurring in sequence, a profile
      processor is not obliged to perform them in the order described. Conformance to these
      specifications is determined by whether the results of processing (<term>resolution</term>)
      appear as described, not on whether the means to produce those results work in exactly the
      manner described here.</p>
    <p>The three steps are <src>import</src> (control <term>selection</term>); <src>merge</src>; and
        <src>modify</src>. In brief:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><src>import</src> identifies one or more control sources (catalogs or profiles) and the
          controls within them to be included in this profile;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><src>merge</src> produces the rules for how controls will be organized and merged (or
          not);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><src>modify</src> indicates how parameters in the underlying catalog may be modified or
          set, and how control contents may be amended or modified.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <term>selection</term> (import) stage is mandatory inasmuch as a profile that imports no
      controls is inoperative. Such a profile is not in error and it can be resolved, but its
      resolution will contain no controls (and as such might fail a validation check against the
      catalog schema).</p>
    <p>The <term>merge</term> stage can be considered mandatory in that there are default rules for
      merging, to be followed when no merge behavior is given; thus <q>no merging</q> is permitted,
      and a profile with no merge semantics indicated is not in error.</p>
    <p>The <term>modify</term> stage is optional in that controls do not have to be modified and
      parameters do not have to be set; a profile is always free to represent these components as
      they are given in their catalogs. Leaving a parameter unset, or qualifying its setting (with
      additional information or constraints) without modifying its value, is also possible; like a
      catalog, a profile can represent a set of controls and parameters that are not fully defined
      or are defined only at a general level, for purposes of use at another layer (profile or
      implementation) where more specific definition and guidance can be provided.</p>
    <p>As described in the previous section, when resolved, an OSCAL profile takes the form of an
      OSCAL catalog. The merge semantics described below will produce outputs conforming to this
      organization.</p>
    <section id="import-selections">
      <head>Import - select controls</head>
      <p>A profile begins by importing catalogs, all of whose controls are made available. Each
        import constitutes a <term>selection</term> of controls from a catalog or profile. Imports
        are given in sequence after the metadata:</p>
      <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;profile>
  &lt;metadata>[ Profile metadata ]&lt;/metadata>
  &lt;import href="#catalog">... selection of controls ...&lt;/import>
  &lt;import href="#catalog-supplemental">... selection of controls ...&lt;/import>
&lt;/profile>
</tagging>
      <tagging whose="target_catalog">&lt;profile>
  &lt;metadata>[ Profile metadata ]&lt;/metadata>
  &lt;selection href="#catalog" catalog-id="{catalog-identifier}">... selection of controls ...&lt;/selection>
  &lt;selection href="#catalog-supplemental" catalog-id="{catalog-identifier}">... selection of controls ...&lt;/selection>
&lt;/profile>
</tagging>
      <p>The resource indicated can be either an OSCAL catalog or an OSCAL profile. A catalog
        provides controls in their native form. An imported profile is resolved on import, using the
        same rules for profile resolution, so a catalog is presented to the importing profile.</p>
      <p>(The result of importing other endpoints or resources besides valid OSCAL catalogs and
        profiles, is not defined by this specification.)</p>
      <p>No profile may import itself either directly or indirectly. An import directive that
        indicates either the profile itself, or a profile into which it is being (currently)
        imported, must be ignored. Optionally, a processor may issue a warning.</p>
      <p>In an import directive, the reference to the resource to be imported appears on an
          <src>@href</src> flag. It takes either of two forms, external or internal:</p>
      <section id="import-via-uri">
        <head>External - import via URI</head>
        <p>An external reference appears as an absolute or relative URL</p>

&lt;/import>
</tagging>
      </section>
      <section id="import-via-resource">
        <head>Internal - import via resource</head>
        <p>A catalog or profile to be imported can also be indicated using an internal link via a
          URI fragment identifier (starting with <code>#</code>). If an import href resolves to a
            <code>resource</code> elsewhere in the profile (typically in back matter), that resource
          can be retrieved to provide the source catalog.</p>

        <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;import href="#nist-sp800-53_catalog">

        <p>A reference from an import to a resource that does not reference a catalog or profile, or

        <head>Multiple imports</head>
        <p>In the selection stage, each import directive is processed to produce a set of controls
          and (when they are referenced) parameters. These controls and parameters are represented
          in the form of a control selection. Note that this occurs in the selection stage even if
          the same catalog (resource) is imported multiple times: each distinct import collects
          controls into a <tgt>selection</tgt>:</p>
        <mapping unit-test="profile-resolution-examples/import-twice_profile.xml">

        <p>The control selections are combined and collapsed in the next stage of processing,

        <p>Multiple imports may result in outputs with clashing controls (see below). Typically this
          will be because a control has been selected twice, and no merge behavior has been
          indicated to resolve the clash.</p>
        <p>In general, sibling imports (two imports into the same profile) should never have to call
          the same catalog; and this condition may be reported as a warning. More typical cases of
          multiple imports of the same resource will be when a profile A imports another profile B,
          which calls catalog Z, and then profile A calls catalog Z again to acquire controls not
          included in profile B, or as unmodified by profile B.</p>

            <p>In OSCAL, controls may contain controls. For example, in SP 800-53 many controls are
              supplemented with control enhancements; in OSCAL these are represented as child
              controls within parent controls. So parent AC-2 has children AC-2(1) through AC-2(13),
              for example.</p>
            <p>Child controls can be included by the same mechanism as controls, i.e. by means of an
              ID call. Alternatively a match can frequently be applied (at least given most ID
              assignment schemes) to match controls and child controls together.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a <src>@with-child-controls</src> directive on a <src>call</src> or
                <src>match</src> can indicate that child controls (that is, direct children not all
              descendants) should be included with the applicable call(s) or match(es).</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <src>all[@with-child-controls='no']</src> may select all controls placed
              directly within a group, excluding all controls appearing inside other controls.</p>

          <p><revisit>What about when a control is excluded, but it has descendant controls that are

        <head>Copying parameters</head>
        <p>Unlike controls, parameters are copied implicitly. Whether a parameter in the source

          referenced by an <tgt>insert</tgt> directive in the result catalog.</p>
        <p><src>insert</src> directives may occur anywhere in a catalog's data content including not
          only in controls, but in other parameters. Thus a parameter may have to be included by
          virtue of an <src>insert</src> directive, making reference to it, that occurs in another
          parameter, included by virtue of a different <src>insert</src> directive found in an
          included control.</p>
        <p>A reasonable strategy for implementing this requirement is to copy all parameters through
          to control selections in the <term>selection</term> phase, and then remove all parameters

        <head>Circular imports</head>
        <p>When a profile imports a profile, the subordinate profile is resolved into a catalog

          directed to import itself either directly or indirectly.</p>
        <p>A <term>circular import</term> is defined as a directive to import a resource, which has
          already been called higher in the import hierarchy. For example, if Profile A imports
          Profile B, and Profile B imports Profile A, the second import is circular. (An import at
          the top can only be circular if a profile tries to import itself.) If A imports B, B
          imports C and C imports A, C’s import is circular.</p>
        <p>Note that an import can only be circular within the context of processing a particular
          profile. In the last example, C’s import would not be circular if invoked in the context
          of resolving B by itself (without being imported by A), or of resolving some other profile
          that did not import A. (D importing B importing C importing A would not be a problem.)</p>

        <head><src>merge/combine</src> - handling control collisions</head>
        <p><term>Colliding controls</term> (or <term>clashing</term>) describes the condition that
          occurs when multiple invocations of controls with the same ID are given, and so a profile
          resolution will result in duplicative and/or contradictory information. Even given a rule
          against multiple imports of the same resource, it may frequently occur that in profiles
          (especially profiles under development), multiple copies – and with variations – may be
          invoked from different sources. For example, if a profile tailors another profile which
          includes a control with amendments, and then (the top-level profile) includes the same
          control directly from its original catalog, a collision will occur between these two
          variants.</p>
        <p>Generally such a collision is readily detectable as long as IDs have not been modified;
          in other words, constraints over uniqueness (within document scope) of IDs will be
          violated in resolved instances where two (perhaps different) representations of the same
          control appear. Careful profile authors will be able to detect and prevent these resulting
          problems.</p>
        <p>Apart from handling problems and exceptions, however, for different purposes different
          profiles might wish to apply different rules. OSCAL offers three such rules: the
          directives for each are given as a value on the <src>@method</src> attribute of a profile
            <src>merge/combine</src> element.</p>
        <section id="no-merge-explicit">
          <head>No <src>merge/combine</src> given</head>
          <p>If no <src>merge</src> directive is given in the profile, or if a <src>merge</src> is
            given without a <src>combine</src>, control or parameter clashes are treated as if
              <src>merge/combine[@method='keep']</src> were given. A profile with no
              <src>merge</src> directive:</p>

          <p>When a merge is indicated by <src>merge combine[@method='keep']</src>, or not given,
            the <q>no merge</q> combination rule is used. Clashing controls or parameters are not

          <p>Under this directive, colliding controls will result in invalid results, as they will

            ensuring integrity of references to controls as given in the profile: if any included

          <p>The single unified representation is assembled by aggregating all the contents of all
            the (clashing) control instances and discarding duplicate branches.</p>

          <head>Effects of combination rules on back matter</head>
          <p>When profiles import from more than one resource (catalog or profile), not only is
            there a potential for clashing controls, but also citation and resource elements
            appearing in the back matter, may clash with other citations and resources, yielding
            validation errors in the result when an ID appears more than once.</p>
          <p>This situation is not remedied by the <q>no merge</q> combination rule. Under this
            rule, any citation or resource that is referenced from an imported catalog or profile,
            is included in the resolution result.</p>
          <p>Under the <q>use first</q> rule (with <src>merge/combine[@method='use-first']</src>),
            only the first <src>citation</src> with a given ID is kept from the set of citations
            (gathered from all sources). Likewise only the first <src>resource</src> with a given ID
            is kept from the set of resources. Note that uncontrolled identifiers may still clash –
            for example, this will not prevent a <tgt>citation</tgt> and <tgt>resource</tgt> from
            appearing in the result with the same ID (perhaps sourced from two different catalogs).
            Control and possibly revision of upstream data sets is necessary to prevent such

            <head>Implicit inclusions under <src>as-is</src></head>
            <p>Under <term>as is</term>, a resolved profile’s structure is expected to replicate the
              structure of source catalogs.</p>
            <p>This is achieved by propagating, with all controls that are included, all groups that
              they appear within, along with the groups’ IDs, titles and other contents, apart from
              controls not included in one or another control selection.</p>
            <p>Groups that do not include controls that have been included (either directly or as
              descendants of contained groups), are not propagated to the result.</p>
            <p>In addition to groups, under 'as is' mergine, certain controls will be included
              implicitly. This happens when they have not been called, but they contain controls
              that have been called. Such controls are treated like groups included 'as is' – they
              must be propagated to retain the structure for descendant controls. Apart from their
              titles, however, their contents – aparts from controls that are included or controls
              that must be included by virtue of included descendant controls – do not appear in the
              target.</p>
            <p>This is slightly different from groups, which may in valid inputs have other contents
              – besides titles, controls, or groups – that profile authors wish to see copied into
              the customized catalog.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <tagging whose="source_catalog">&lt;control id="xyz-1">
  &lt;title>Basic Household&lt;/title>
  &lt;control id="xyz-1.1">&lt;!-- bedtime routine -->...&lt;/control>
  &lt;control id="xyz-1.2">
    &lt;title>Kitchen cleanup&lt;/title>
	&lt;control id="xyz-1.2.1">&lt;!-- kitchen trashcan -->...&lt;/control>
  &lt;/control>
  &lt;control id="xyz-1.3">&lt;!-- newspaper delivery -->...&lt;/control>
&lt;/control>

</tagging>
            <p>In this case the profile does not designate either control <code>xyz-1</code> or
              control <code>xyz-1.2</code> for inclusion</p>
            <tagging whose="source_profile">&lt;import href="#XYZ-catalog">

    &lt;call control-id='xyz-1.1'/>&lt;!-- bedtime routine -->
    &lt;call control-id='xyz-1.2.1'/>&lt;!-- kitchen trashcan -->
  &lt;/include>
&lt;/import>
</tagging>
            <p>The unmentioned elements are included, however, with their titles, because controls
              that they contain are included. But control <code>xyz-1.3</code> does not appear in
              the result.</p>
            <tagging whose="target_catalog">&lt;control id="xyz-1">
  &lt;title>Basic Hygiene&lt;/title>
  &lt;control id="xyz-1.1">&lt;!-- bedtime routine -->...&lt;/control>
  &lt;control id="xyz-1.2">
    &lt;title>Kitchen cleanup&lt;/title>
	&lt;control id="xyz-1.2.1">&lt;!-- kitchen trashcan -->...&lt;/control>
  &lt;/control>
&lt;/control>

</tagging>
            <p>Note that this means there may be controls that are selected implicitly by
                <tgt>as-is</tgt> merging, over and above controls actually designated in import
              statements. Thus the control set, considered strictly, of the target of an
                <tgt>as-is</tgt> process, will be different from the control set delivered by a

      <p>(Aka <term>patching</term>) Explicit modification of control content</p>
      <p>There are two ways a control may need to be modified. Commonly, controls might be amended –
        new material might be added. (For example, the priority marker properties P1-P3 in the
        SP800-53 LOW MODERATE and HIGH baselines.) Less commonly, materials might be removed or
        edited.</p>
      <p>OSCAL does not provide for <q>changing</q> a control, but editing can be achieved by
        removing contents and adding (edited) contents back. In other words, editing is considered
        to be the same kind of patching as removing combined with adding.</p>
      <p>In addition to any modification or adjustment to controls, this section of a profile is
        used to set parameter values or other properties of parameters declared in catalogs and
        referenced from their text. Parameters are propagated with the profile's setting into the
        result catalog for its use.</p>
      <section id="param-setting">
        <head>Setting Parameters</head>
        <p>Modification of parameter settings is indicated using <src>set</src>.</p>
        <p>Parameters are not always given within controls. A profile resolution result must include
          copies (with or without modifications or settings) of all parameters defined within the
          source catalog, which are referenced from <src>insert</src> directives anywhere inside
          included controls.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, any parameter referenced by an <src>insert</src> in any source catalog is
          copied from catalog source to result <revisit>parameter propagation rules for merge/as-is,

        <head>Altering controls</head>
        <p>A control can be altered by an <src>alter</src> directive on a control. The
            <src>@control-id</src> flag on the <src>alter</src> indicates the control to which the
          alteration is applied.</p>
        <section>
          <head>Adding contents to controls</head>
          <p>Contents may be added to controls using an add directive inside an alter directive.
            There are two forms of alteration: with implicit and explicit bindings.</p>
          <section>
            <head>Implicit binding</head>
            <p>An <src>add</src> directive with no <src>id-ref</src> flag is taken to apply to the
              control as a whole. Its <src>position</src> flag may be either of two values:
                <code>starting</code> and <code>ending</code>.</p>
            <p>The contents of the add directive are then added to the control contents in the
              result, either after its <tgt>title</tgt> when <src>position</src> is
                <code>starting</code>, or at the end if its position is <code>ending</code>.</p>
            <p>However, control contents in catalogs must appear in the order <code>title, param,
                prop, link, part, control</code>. Subsequent to adding new elements, the control
              contents are sorted to appear in the required order. As a consequence, a new
                <tgt>prop</tgt> appears after any <src>prop</src> already in the control, when
                <src>position</src> is <code>ending</code>, or before any <src>prop</src> in the
              control when <src>position</src> is <code>starting</code>.</p>
            <p>When add has no <src>@ref-id</src> (has an implicit binding), the <src>position</src>
              values <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> are inoperative. A processor may
              issue a warning if they are encountered.</p>

            <head>Explicit binding</head>
            <p>An explicit binding on an addition permits inserting new contents anywhere in a
              control, not only at the top level. It is given by a <src>@ref-id</src> flag on the
                <src>add</src> directive. The value of the <src>@ref-id</src> must correspond to the
              value of an <src>@id</src> flag on an element inside the control, and not the control
              itself. If <src>ref-id</src> does not correspond to such a value, the <src>add</src>
              directive is inoperative. Optionally, a warning may be issued in such a case.</p>
            <p>The element with <src>@id</src> equal to the <src>@ref-id</src> is considered the
                <term>target</term> of the addition.</p>
            <p>Additionally, with an explicit binding given by a <src>@ref-id</src>,
                <src>@position</src> may have any of the values <code>starting</code>,
                <code>ending</code>, <code>before</code> and <code>after</code>.</p>
            <p>When <src>position</src> is <code>starting</code> or <code>ending</code>, the new
              contents are added at the beginning or ending of the target element, inside that
              element, as are additions into controls (using implicit bindings).</p>
            <p>Additionally, a <src>position</src> given as <code>before</code> indicates the
              addition should be made directly before the target element, while <code>after</code>
              indicates the addition should appear directly after the target element.</p>
            <p><revisit>Unlike additions with implicit bindings, an explicit binding does not
                provide for sorting of newly added elements to ensure correct ordering.
                Consequently, profile authors must take care that additions they make into control
                contents using explicit bindings will produce results valid to the catalog
                schema.</revisit></p>

              <p>Note that the <src>add</src> directive identifies the element with <src>@id</src>

              <p>The <src>position</src> is <code>after</code> so both elements inside

                element is inside another <tgt>part</tgt> in the control, the new additions appear
                there as well.</p>
              <p>Note that the result in this case will be schema-invalid since a <tgt>prop</tgt>
                may not occur directly following a <tgt>part</tgt>. A better result can be obtained
                by using two <src>add</src> directives, to insert the new <tgt>prop</tgt> separately
                before any <tgt>part</tgt> elements in the result.</p>

            <head>Usage of <src>add</src> directives modifying controls inside controls</head>
            <p>OSCAL supports control extensions inside controls in the form of <src>control</src>
              elements inside <src>control</src> elements. Because the semantics of the
                <src>add</src> directive target any (element) contents of controls, they can be used
              to target these control extensions for modification as well as other contents.</p>
            <p>Because such a control can already be modified using implicit bindings, it is
              recommended that they not be targeted with explicit bindings. Using an implicit
              binding supports more robust alteration since contents in the result can be ordered
              properly by the resolution processor.</p>

          <head>Removing contents from controls</head>
          <p>Contents inside controls can be removed from them in catalog results. In combination
            with adding new contents, this feature can be used to edit controls as well as amend
            them.</p>
          <p>A <src>remove</src> directive inside an <src>alter</src> directive identifies an
            element or set of elements inside a control to be removed. It does this using any of
            four flags:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><src>@id-ref</src>, like <src>add/@id-ref</src>, matches an element by its
                  <src>@id</src> value.</p>
              <p>Because <src>@id</src> values are unique, the remove directive will remove only a
                single element.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><src>@name-ref</src> keys to the <src>@name</src> attribute on any element inside
                the control.</p>
              <p>Any element inside the control with the assigned <src>name</src>, is removed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><src>@class-ref</src> keys to the <src>@class</src> attribute on any element inside
                the control. All elements with matching <src>class</src> are removed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><src>@item-name</src> keys to the element or property name; for example,
                  <code>&lt;remove item-name='prop'/></code> has the effect of removing all
                  <src>prop</src> elements from inside the control. <revisit>(NB: what about in JSON
                  where names are often group names? Can we support removal by item
                name?)</revisit></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are examined in the order given here; the first one that appears is used. Thus a
            remove directive with both a <src>name-ref</src> and a <src>class-ref</src>, uses only
            the <src>name-ref</src>. <revisit>(Or should the effect be cumulative?)</revisit></p>
          <p>Unlike an <src>add</src> directive, a <src>remove</src> may not be bound implicitly to
            the control; its binding, to contents inside the control, must be explicit.</p>
          <p>To remove an control, simply avoid selecting it into the profile, or exclude it
            specifically using <src>import/exclude</src>.</p>
          <p>As with <src>add</src>, a remove that targets any element outside the control, is
            inoperative. Similarly, a remove directive that indicates that all <tgt>prop</tgt>
            elements should be removed from the result catalog, applies only to <src>prop</src></p>

          <p>Finally some alterations are made automatically.</p>
          <p>For example, <src>link</src> elements in source data representing cross-references in a
            catalog, may no longer be effective in catalogs produced from profiles, which have not
            included the elements (controls or other) to which the links refer.</p>
